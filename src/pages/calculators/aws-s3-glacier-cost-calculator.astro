  intro="Estimate archival storage costs with a simple model: storage (GB-month) plus retrieval (GB and requests). Use your effective prices for your storage class and retrieval tier."
  examples={[
    "10,000 GB-month stored at $0.004/GB-month with 500 GB/month retrieval at $0.01/GB and 2M retrieval requests at $0.05 per 1k.",

    "Storage baseline from GB-month and $/GB-month.",
    "Retrieval data volume from GB/month and $/GB.",
    "Retrieval request charges from requests/month and $ per 1,000 requests.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Minimum storage duration and early deletion fees (model separately if relevant).",
    "Internet egress and downstream analysis costs (Athena, SIEM, etc.).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Storage cost = stored GB-month x $ per GB-month.",
    "Retrieval GB cost = retrieval GB/month x $ per GB.",
    "Retrieval request cost = (requests/month / 1,000) x $ per 1,000 requests.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What is GB-month for archival storage?",
      a: "GB-month is the average stored gigabytes over a month. If you store 10,000 GB for the full month, that is 10,000 GB-month.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why is retrieval cost hard to estimate?",
      a: "Retrieval pricing varies by storage class and retrieval tier, and your cost depends on how often you read back data and how many objects you retrieve (requests).",
    },
    {
      q: "What causes unexpected Glacier/Deep Archive bills?",
      a: "Frequent restores, large retrieval volume, many small-object retrieval requests, and early deletion fees due to minimum storage duration rules.",
