  intro="Data transfer is often the hardest cloud line item to predict. This AWS VPC data transfer cost calculator helps you estimate monthly spend from GB/month and your $/GB assumptions. Use it for cross-zone, cross-region, and internet egress style modeling."

    "If you move 2,000 GB/month across boundaries at your $/GB -> estimate monthly transfer spend.",

    "Useful for internet egress, cross-boundary transfers, and general transfer modeling.",

  excludes={[
    "Per-hour gateway fees (e.g., NAT gateway hourly) and per-connection pricing.",
    "Provider-specific exceptions and free allowances unless you model them separately.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Monthly transfer cost = GB/month x $/GB.",
    "If you have multiple transfer types (internet egress, cross-region, cross-zone), model each separately and sum.",

      q: "What should I use for GB/month?",
      a: "Start from monitoring/flow logs/billing exports. If you only have average throughput, convert Mbps to GB/month with the Units Converter.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why are transfer bills surprising?",
      a: "Because many architectures have hidden east-west traffic. Cross-zone service calls, replication, and cache fill can create large GB/month totals.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I avoid underestimating cross-AZ transfer?",
      a: "Segment by architecture: load balancer paths, service-to-service calls, and replication. Validate AZ locality (client and backend in the same AZ) and model a peak scenario.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GB/month</strong>: start from billing exports or flow logs; if you only have throughput charts, convert
        Mbps to GB/month using <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units converter</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>$ / GB</strong>: use your effective rate for the specific boundary (cross-AZ, cross-region, internet).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Boundary mix is the primary driver; split cross-AZ, cross-region, and internet.</li>
      <li>Small % increases in east-west traffic can outweigh compute savings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mixing boundaries (cross-AZ vs cross-region vs internet) and using the wrong $/GB rate.</li>
      <li>Ignoring cache fill / origin egress (CDN) that shifts cost to another place.</li>
      <li>Under-modeling retries/timeouts that multiply traffic during incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Boundary</th>
          <th>GB/month</th>
          <th>Drivers</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Cross-AZ</td>
          <td>Expected</td>
          <td>Normal traffic</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>Cross-region</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>Failover/migration</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Validate top transfer paths and their boundaries (cross-AZ vs cross-region vs internet).</li>
      <li>Re-check after routing or AZ locality changes; small shifts can create big costs.</li>
      <li>Compare measured GB/month to billing usage types and adjust assumptions.</li>
    </ul>
