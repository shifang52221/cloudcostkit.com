  intro="Data transfer is often the hardest cloud line item to predict. This VPC data transfer cost calculator helps you estimate monthly spend from GB/month and your $/GB assumptions. Use it for cross-zone, cross-region, and internet egress style modeling."
  examples={[
    "If you move 2,000 GB/month across boundaries at your $/GB -> estimate monthly transfer spend.",
    "Transfer costs can exceed compute for chatty microservices or data-heavy pipelines.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Transfer cost estimate from GB/month and $/GB pricing assumptions.",
    "Useful for internet egress, cross-boundary transfers, and general transfer modeling.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Per-hour gateway fees (e.g., NAT gateway hourly) and per-connection pricing.",
    "Provider-specific exceptions and free allowances unless you model them separately.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Monthly transfer cost = GB/month × $/GB.",
    "If you have multiple transfer types (internet egress, cross-region, cross-zone), model each separately and sum.",
    "If you have free allowances, subtract them before applying rates."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What should I use for GB/month?",
      a: "Start from monitoring/flow logs/billing exports. If you only have average throughput, convert Mbps to GB/month with the Units Converter.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why are transfer bills surprising?",
      a: "Because many architectures have hidden east-west traffic. Cross-zone service calls, replication, and cache fill can create large GB/month totals.",
