    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Replication fees scale with changed data, not total stored GB.</li>
      <li>Backfills and migrations should be modeled as separate peak months.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Changed GB</th>
          <th>Direction</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Expected</td>
          <td>Primary -> replica</td>
          <td>Steady writes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>Primary -> replica</td>
          <td>Backfill/migration</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
    </ul>
