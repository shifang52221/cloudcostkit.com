  intro="S3 replication and cross-region copies are driven by changed data volume. Use this S3 replication cost calculator to estimate monthly replication fees from replicated GB/month and your per-GB assumption."
  examples={[
    "50 GB/day of changed data replicated cross-region (~1,520 GB/month) at your $/GB -> estimate replication fee.",
    "Replication volume is often far smaller than total stored GB because it's driven by writes and churn.",

    "Replication fee estimate from replicated GB/month and $/GB pricing assumptions.",
    "Useful for cross-region replication, backup copy traffic, and sync workloads.",

  excludes={[
    "Replica storage costs (model separately).",
    "Provider-specific billing rules and request pricing unless you add them separately.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Monthly replication fee = replicated GB/month x $/GB.",
    "Estimate replicated GB/month from write volume and churn (changed data), not from total stored dataset size.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "How do I estimate replicated GB/month?",
      a: "Start from write volume (GB/day) or PUTs/day x average object size, then multiply by days per month and replication coverage.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does replication include destination storage?",
      a: "No. Replication usually means storing data twice. Add destination storage as a separate line item.",
