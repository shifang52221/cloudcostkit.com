  intro="CloudWatch Logs-style pricing is commonly driven by ingestion volume and retention. This page helps you estimate a practical monthly total by combining ingestion and retention storage line items using your own assumptions."
  examples={[
    "Estimate ingestion from GB/day and a $/GB rate, then estimate retained storage from retention days and $/GB-month.",
    "Retention can dominate total cost when you keep high-volume logs for 90+ days.",

  includes={[
    "Ingestion estimate from GB/day and $/GB assumptions.",
    "Retention storage estimate from GB/day, retention days, and $/GB-month assumptions.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Query/scan charges and premium features (model separately if billed).",
    "Region-tiered pricing unless you use blended rates or separate scenarios.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Ingestion cost = GB/day x days/month x $/GB.",
    "Retained storage (steady state) ~ GB/day x retention days; apply $/GB-month.",
    "Sum the two line items for a monthly estimate.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why does retention matter so much?",
      a: "Storage is billed per GB-month. Longer retention multiplies the amount of stored data even if ingestion stays flat.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I reduce costs quickly?",
      a: "Reduce noisy logs at source, shorten retention for low-value logs, and avoid retaining high-volume debug logs in hot storage.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">CloudWatch-specific gotchas to model separately</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li><strong>Query/scan</strong>: if you use Logs Insights heavily, scan volume can be a separate line item.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscription filters</strong>: forwarding logs can move data into another system that also charges ingestion.</li>
      <li><strong>High-cardinality fields</strong>: can increase downstream costs when you index/aggregate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px">
      Use this page for the “baseline” ingestion + retention model, then add scan/exports as separate scenarios.
    </p>

  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Volume</strong>: start from measured ingestion (GB/day) if you have it, then convert to monthly/retention where needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention</strong>: decide retention days and model steady-state GB-month.</li>
      <li><strong>Queries</strong>: model scan/query volume if your tool bills by GB scanned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling ingestion but forgetting retention (GB-month) and scan/query costs.</li>
      <li>Keeping noisy logs forever instead of setting explicit retention tiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Check ingestion GB/day and retention GB-month after changes.</li>
      <li>Check query scan GB and dashboard refresh frequency (common hidden driver).</li>
    </ul>
