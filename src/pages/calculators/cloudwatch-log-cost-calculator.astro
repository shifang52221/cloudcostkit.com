  intro="CloudWatch Logs-style pricing is commonly driven by ingestion volume and retention. This page helps you estimate a practical monthly total by combining ingestion and retention storage line items using your own assumptions."
  examples={[
    "Estimate ingestion from GB/day and a $/GB rate, then estimate retained storage from retention days and $/GB-month.",
    "Retention can dominate total cost when you keep high-volume logs for 90–365 days.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Ingestion estimate from GB/day and $/GB assumptions.",
    "Retention storage estimate from GB/day, retention days, and $/GB-month assumptions.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Query/scan charges and premium features (model separately if billed).",
    "Region-tiered pricing unless you use blended rates or separate scenarios.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Ingestion cost = GB/day × days/month × $/GB.",
    "Retained storage (steady-state) ≈ GB/day × retention days; apply $/GB-month.",
    "Sum the two line items for a monthly estimate."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why does retention matter so much?",
      a: "Storage is billed per GB-month. Longer retention multiplies the amount of stored data even if ingestion stays flat.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I reduce costs quickly?",
      a: "Reduce noisy logs at source, shorten retention for low-value logs, and avoid retaining high-volume debug logs in hot storage.",
