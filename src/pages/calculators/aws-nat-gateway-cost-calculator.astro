    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>NAT gateways</strong>: count NAT gateways per AZ (teams often run 1 per AZ for HA).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hours/day and days/month</strong>: use real uptime windows (24 x 30.4 for always-on).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GB processed</strong>: pull from NAT metrics or VPC Flow Logs, or estimate from throughput charts (Mbps to
        GB/month).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pricing</strong>: use region-specific NAT hourly and per-GB rates.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If traffic share is high, focus on data path changes (endpoints, caching, or egress routing).</li>
      <li>If hourly share dominates, review gateway count and uptime windows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling only the hourly fee and ignoring GB processed (usually the bigger driver).</li>
      <li>Forgetting that "small" downloads multiply across fleets (node bootstrap, image pulls, package updates).</li>
      <li>Ignoring retries/timeouts that multiply outbound traffic during incidents.</li>
      <li>Assuming endpoints automatically replace NAT without checking the traffic mix.</li>
      <li>Estimating GB from peak throughput without averaging over the month.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Gateways</th>
          <th>GB processed</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Current</td>
          <td>Expected</td>
          <td>Normal releases</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>Current</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>Patch/upgrade window</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Watch NAT GB processed trend (it should drop if endpoints/caching are working).</li>
      <li>Confirm you did not increase cross-AZ/cross-region transfer elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Re-check during peak/incident windows (that's when hidden multipliers show up).</li>
      <li>Compare NAT gateway-hours and GB processed with billing line items.</li>
    </ul>
