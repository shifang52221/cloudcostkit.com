    },
    {
      q: "Does this include internet egress charges?",

    {
      q: "Why do NAT bills spike?",
      a: "Costs scale with both time (gateway-hours) and traffic (GB processed). High-throughput workloads, software updates, or container image pulls behind NAT can quickly increase GB processed.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>NAT gateways</strong>: count NAT gateways per AZ (teams often run 1 per AZ for HA).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hours/month</strong>: use ~730 for always-on (or your billing convention).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GB processed</strong>: pull from NAT metrics or VPC Flow Logs, or estimate from throughput charts (Mbps to
        GB/month).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling only the hourly fee and ignoring GB processed (usually the bigger driver).</li>
      <li>Forgetting that "small" downloads multiply across fleets (node bootstrap, image pulls, package updates).</li>
      <li>Ignoring retries/timeouts that multiply outbound traffic during incidents.</li>
      <li>Assuming endpoints automatically replace NAT without checking the traffic mix.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Watch NAT GB processed trend (it should drop if endpoints/caching are working).</li>
      <li>Confirm you did not increase cross-AZ/cross-region transfer elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Re-check during peak/incident windows (that's when hidden multipliers show up).</li>
    </ul>
