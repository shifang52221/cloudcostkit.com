  intro="Estimate NAT Gateway-style cost using a simple model: hourly gateway fees + per-GB data processing. Use your effective region pricing."
  examples={[
    "1 NAT gateway running 730 hours/month with 2,000 GB processed — estimate hourly + traffic charges.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Hourly component from NAT gateways × hours/month × $/hour.",
    "Traffic component from GB processed × $/GB processed.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Internet egress $/GB charges (model separately if applicable).",
    "Other transfer fees (cross-AZ/cross-region) depending on your architecture.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Hourly cost = NAT gateways × hours per month × $ per NAT gateway-hour.",
    "Traffic cost = GB processed per month × $ per GB processed.",
    "Total = hourly cost + traffic cost.",
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What is “GB processed” for NAT Gateway?",
      a: "It’s the volume of traffic that traverses the NAT gateway. Track it via VPC Flow Logs or NAT metrics, or estimate from throughput over time.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include internet egress charges?",
      a: "No. NAT Gateway has its own hourly and processing fees, but you may still have separate internet egress costs depending on the destination and service.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why do NAT bills spike?",
      a: "Costs scale with both time (gateway-hours) and traffic (GB processed). High-throughput workloads, software updates, or container image pulls behind NAT can quickly increase GB processed.",
    },
