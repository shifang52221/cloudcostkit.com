    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Baseline RPS</strong>: use CloudWatch or access logs for a representative week.</li>
      <li><strong>Peak windows</strong>: document launches, incidents, or scheduled batch runs.</li>
      <li><strong>Multiplier</strong>: add retries, timeouts, bots, and automated traffic.</li>
    </ul>
