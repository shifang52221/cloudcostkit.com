  intro="EKS costs are usually driven by node compute. This EKS cost calculator helps you size nodes from pod requests and then estimate monthly cost using a per-node $/hour assumption. Add control plane, storage, and observability as separate line items."
  examples={[
    "Use representative pod requests to estimate node count, then multiply by blended $/hour and uptime.",
    "If memory is the bottleneck, node count is driven by memory requests even when CPU looks low.",

  includes={[
    "Requests/limits sizing into cluster totals and node estimate.",
    "Node cost estimate from node count, $/hour, and expected uptime.",

  excludes={[
    "Control plane fees, load balancers, storage, logs/metrics, and data egress (add separately).",
    "Scheduling constraints (affinities, max pods per node) that can increase node count.",

    "Step 1: Convert per-pod requests into totals and an estimated node count.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Do managed control plane fees matter?",
      a: "Often yes. Many managed Kubernetes offerings charge a fixed hourly control plane fee. Add it separately.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I size by requests or limits?",
      a: "Scheduling uses requests. Limits are a safety ceiling and can be much higher than requests.",

      Use representative requests (not peak limits). Choose an allocatable % to reserve capacity for kube-system and

      Multiply estimated node count by $/hour and uptime. Use a blended rate if you mix on-demand, commitments, or spot.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
    </ul>
