  intro="EKS costs are usually driven by node compute. This EKS cost calculator helps you size nodes from pod requests and then estimate monthly cost using a per-node $/hour assumption. Add control plane, storage, and observability as separate line items."
  examples={[
    "Use representative pod requests to estimate node count, then multiply by blended $/hour and uptime.",
    "If memory is the bottleneck, node count is driven by memory requests even when CPU looks low.",

  includes={[
    "Requests/limits sizing into cluster totals and node estimate.",
    "Node cost estimate from node count, $/hour, and expected uptime.",

  excludes={[
    "Control plane fees, load balancers, storage, logs/metrics, and data egress (add separately).",
    "Scheduling constraints (affinities, max pods per node) that can increase node count.",

    "Step 1: Convert per-pod requests into totals and an estimated node count.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Do managed control plane fees matter?",
      a: "Often yes. Many managed Kubernetes offerings charge a fixed hourly control plane fee. Add it separately.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I size by requests or limits?",
      a: "Scheduling uses requests. Limits are a safety ceiling and can be much higher than requests.",
