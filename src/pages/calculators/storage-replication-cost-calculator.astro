  intro="Replication and multi-region storage can add meaningful transfer or feature charges. Use this tool to estimate monthly replication cost from replicated GB and your pricing assumption."
  examples={[
    "2,500 GB/month replicated at $0.02/GB -> $50/month (transfer/feature fee estimate).",
    "50 GB/day of changed data replicated cross-region (~1,520 GB/month) at $0.01/GB -> about $15/month (replication fee only).",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Replication cost estimate from replicated GB/month and a $/GB pricing assumption.",
    "Works for cross-region replication, backup copy traffic, or sync workloads.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Replica storage costs (model separately).",
    "Provider-specific billing rules for replication direction, request pricing, and minimum charges.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Monthly cost = replicated GB per month x price per GB.",
    "Use the GB that actually changes/copies per month (often driven by writes, not the full dataset size).",
    "Replication may be billed as cross-region transfer, a per-GB feature fee, or both depending on product.",
    "Add replica storage, request fees, and any origin egress separately if you pay them."
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Should I use total stored GB or changed GB?",
      a: "Use the GB that actually replicates per month (often driven by writes/changes, not the entire dataset)."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include extra storage in the replica region?",
      a: "No. Model replica storage separately using object storage or database storage tools."
    },
    {
      q: "Is replication billed one-way or both ways?",
      a: "It depends on the product. Many replication features bill for data copied out of the source region only. Check provider docs for directionality."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to include request costs?",
      a: "Sometimes. Replication can increase PUT/GET or list operations and those may be billed. If requests are material for your workload, estimate them in the object storage calculator."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I estimate changed GB per month?",
      a: "Start from write volume (GB/day) or batch sizes, then multiply by days in the month. For event-driven workloads, use logs/metrics to estimate average write throughput."
