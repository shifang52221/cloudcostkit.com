  examples={[
    "If you know GB/day, use it directly: monthly GB ~ GB/day × billing days.",
    "If you only know event rate: GB/day ~ events/s × 86,400 × bytes/event ÷ 1e9 (decimal GB).",

  how={[
    "If you have measured ingestion: monthly GB = GB/day × billing days; ingestion cost = monthly GB × $/GB.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is 1 GB = 1e9 bytes or 1024^3 bytes?",
      a: "Many vendors bill using decimal GB. This calculator uses decimal GB for the event-rate conversion; if your vendor uses GiB, adjust your bytes/event assumption.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I estimate bytes per event?",
      a: "Sample real events (e.g., 100–1000 lines), measure payload size in bytes, and use an average plus a peak multiplier for verbose logs.",
    },

      q: "What if I have multiple log sources?",
      a: "Estimate each source (ingress/access, app logs, audit/security) separately, then add the GB/day totals.",
