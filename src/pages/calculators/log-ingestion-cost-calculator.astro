    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Next line items (do not forget these)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Retention storage</strong>: if you keep 30-365 days, storage can dominate.
        <span class="muted">

          Use <a href="/calculators/log-retention-storage-cost-calculator/">Log retention storage</a>.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scan/search</strong>: dashboards and alerts that scan broad windows can add a second bill.

  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GB/day</strong>: use measured ingestion where possible (billing export or log platform metrics).</li>
      <li><strong>Events/s</strong>: if you only have event rate, sample bytes/event and convert to GB/day.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a peak month for incident or deploy bursts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ingestion is the first bill; retention and scan can easily exceed it.</li>
      <li>Verbose logs and high-cardinality fields drive GB/day faster than traffic growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single blended GB/day and hiding noisy sources.</li>
      <li>Assuming bytes/event is constant during incidents (it usually grows).</li>
      <li>Forgetting that retries and timeouts multiply event volume.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>GB/day</th>
          <th>Bytes/event</th>
          <th>Drivers</th>
        </tr>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Expected</td>
          <td>Typical</td>
          <td>Normal traffic</td>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare estimated GB/day to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track bytes/event and event rate after logging changes.</li>
    </ul>
