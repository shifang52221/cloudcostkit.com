    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Steady-state retention math (why it works)</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
      With a fixed retention window, stored logs are roughly “the last N days” of data. That’s why retained GB can be
      approximated as <strong>GB/day × retention days</strong>. If your ingestion is seasonal, model a baseline and peak
      month separately.

  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Practical knobs</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Reduce volume: drop debug logs, sample high-volume events, or move verbose logs to cheaper storage.</li>
      <li>Shorten hot retention and archive cold data to object storage.</li>
      <li>Index selectively: keep full logs, index only what you query.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Volume</strong>: start from measured ingestion (GB/day) if you have it, then convert to monthly/retention where needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention</strong>: decide retention days and model steady-state GB-month.</li>
      <li><strong>Queries</strong>: model scan/query volume if your tool bills by GB scanned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling ingestion but forgetting retention (GB-month) and scan/query costs.</li>
      <li>Keeping noisy logs forever instead of setting explicit retention tiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Check ingestion GB/day and retention GB-month after changes.</li>
      <li>Check query scan GB and dashboard refresh frequency (common hidden driver).</li>
    </ul>
