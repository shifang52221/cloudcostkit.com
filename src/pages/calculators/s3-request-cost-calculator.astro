  intro="For many storage workloads, request fees are tiny. But for millions of small objects, heavy LIST/HEAD usage, or chatty pipelines, request charges can become a real line item. Use this S3 request cost calculator to estimate request fees from monthly request volume and your provider’s per-1k prices."
  examples={[
    "50M GET + 5M PUT per month at your per-1k pricing -> estimate monthly request fees.",
    "Millions of small objects with frequent metadata reads can make requests non-trivial even when storage GB is modest.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Request fee estimate for S3-like GET and PUT operations using per-1k pricing.",
    "A quick way to sanity-check whether requests are noise or meaningful for your workload.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Storage GB-month pricing (model separately if needed).",
    "Egress costs and replication/copy costs (model separately).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Request cost = (requests / 1,000) × price per 1,000 for each request type.",
    "If you have multiple request classes (e.g., LIST/HEAD/select), model them as separate scenarios and sum.",
    "If your provider prices per 10k/1M instead of per 1k, convert the rate to a per-1k equivalent."
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "When do request fees matter?",
      a: "They matter most when you have millions of small objects and high request rates. For large-object workloads with few operations, storage or egress usually dominates.",
    },
    {
      q: "What about LIST/HEAD requests?",
      a: "Many providers price multiple request classes. If LIST/HEAD are material, estimate them separately and add them to the total.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I get request counts?",
      a: "Use storage access logs, metrics, or billing exports. If you only have RPS, convert it with the RPS-to-monthly requests calculator, then split by request type using observed proportions.",
