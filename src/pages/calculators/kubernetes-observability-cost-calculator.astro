  intro="Observability is a common surprise line item for Kubernetes. This calculator estimates two typical parts: logs (GB ingested) and metrics (active series). Use it as a baseline and validate with your real data."
  examples={[
    "Estimate log ingestion from GB/day and a $/GB rate, then estimate metrics cost from active series and $/series-month.",
    "High-cardinality labels and verbose logs can quickly multiply costs.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Log ingestion cost estimate from GB/day and $/GB assumptions.",
    "Metrics time series cost estimate from active series and $/series-month assumptions.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Tracing costs, long-term archive tiers, and premium features unless you model them separately.",
    "Query/scan charges (model separately if your vendor bills them).",

  how={[
    "Logs: estimate GB/day and apply your per-GB rate.",
    "Metrics: estimate active series and apply your per-series-month rate.",

      a: "A unique metric name + label set. High-cardinality labels can create many series and increase cost.",

    {
      q: "How do I reduce observability cost?",
      a: "Reduce noisy logs at source, limit high-cardinality labels, and define retention tiers based on value.",
