  intro="Estimate DynamoDB-style cost using a simple on-demand-like model: read requests + write requests + storage. Use your effective pricing inputs."
  examples={[
    "2B reads/month, 500M writes/month, 200GB storage — estimate monthly request + storage charges.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Read request cost from reads/month × $ per 1M requests.",
    "Write request cost from writes/month × $ per 1M requests.",
    "Storage cost from GB-month × $/GB-month.",

  excludes={[
    "Provisioned capacity (RCU/WCU) modeling, auto scaling dynamics, and reserved capacity discounts.",
    "Streams, backups, data transfer, and monitoring/logging unless you model separately.",

  how={[
    "Read cost = (reads per month / 1,000,000) × $ per 1M read requests.",
    "Write cost = (writes per month / 1,000,000) × $ per 1M write requests.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Should I use on-demand or provisioned pricing?",
      a: "This tool is an on-demand-like model using per-request pricing inputs. If you run provisioned capacity, you can convert your effective cost into per-request equivalents or use a scenario-based estimate.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does item size matter?",
      a: "Yes. Item size affects capacity consumption and storage. This calculator assumes you already reflected those effects in your effective per-request pricing inputs.",
    },
    {
      q: "What about DynamoDB Streams and backups?",
      a: "Not included. Model those as additional line items if you use them heavily.",
