  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What counts as a delivery?",
      a: "A delivery is typically one message sent to one subscription endpoint. If a topic has N subscribers, one published message can create up to N deliveries (after filtering).",
    },
    {
      q: "Why can SNS costs spike during incidents?",
      a: "Incidents can increase publish volume (alerts) and delivery retries. High fan-out topics can multiply deliveries quickly.",

      q: "Should I include payload transfer?",
      a: "If you deliver to internet endpoints or across billable network paths, transfer can matter. If your traffic path has negligible transfer charges, set $/GB to 0 for a request-only estimate.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
    </ul>
