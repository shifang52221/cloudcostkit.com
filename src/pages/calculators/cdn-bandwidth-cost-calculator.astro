    "If your CDN serves 4,000 GB/month at $0.06/GB, estimated bandwidth cost is $240/month.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is CDN bandwidth the same as origin egress?",
      a: "Not necessarily. CDN providers bill bandwidth at the edge; origin egress may be separate if the CDN pulls from your origin."
    },
    {
      q: "What about request charges?",
      a: "Many CDNs charge per request (e.g., per 10k). This calculator is bandwidth-only."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I estimate GB per month?",
      a: "You can approximate from throughput or traffic analytics. Use the Units Converter for Mbps → GB/month estimates."
