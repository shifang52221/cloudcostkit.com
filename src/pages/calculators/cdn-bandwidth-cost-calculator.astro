  intro="CDN bandwidth charges can dominate costs for media-heavy and global traffic. Use this calculator to estimate monthly CDN bandwidth spend using your own $/GB assumptions."
  examples={[
    "If your CDN serves 4,000 GB/month at $0.06/GB, estimated bandwidth cost is $240/month.",
    "If you serve 30 TB/month at $0.05/GB, estimated bandwidth cost is about $1,536/month.",

  includes={[
    "Bandwidth-only CDN cost estimate from GB/month and $/GB pricing.",
    "Use for planning and comparing pricing tiers/regions.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "CDN request fees (use CDN Request Cost Calculator).",
    "Origin egress and cache fill traffic (model separately if applicable).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Monthly cost = CDN egress GB x price per GB.",
    "Enter your provider's effective bandwidth $/GB (consider region/tier).",
    "If pricing is tiered, use a blended $/GB (or run multiple scenarios).",
    "This calculator is bandwidth-only; add request fees and origin egress separately if you pay them."
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is CDN bandwidth the same as origin egress?",
      a: "Not necessarily. CDN providers bill bandwidth at the edge; origin egress may be separate if the CDN pulls from your origin."
    },
    {
      q: "What about request charges?",
      a: "Many CDNs charge per request (e.g., per 10k). This calculator is bandwidth-only."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I estimate GB per month?",
      a: "Use traffic analytics (bytes transferred) if you have it. If you only have throughput, use the Units Converter to convert Mbps to GB/month."
    },
    {
      q: "Does cache hit rate change bandwidth billed by the CDN?",
      a: "The CDN edge bandwidth to end users is still billed as bandwidth. Cache hit rate mainly changes your origin egress and origin request volume."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I include cache fill / prefetch traffic?",
      a: "If your CDN pulls large objects from origin, you may pay origin egress for cache fill. Model that separately with the Data Egress calculator."
    },
    {
      q: "What about free bandwidth tiers?",
      a: "If your plan includes free allowances, subtract them from GB/month before applying $/GB, or use an effective blended rate."
