    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Counts</strong>: start from inventory (custom metrics, alarms, dashboards) per account/environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Cardinality</strong>: model multiplicative dimensions (service x env x cluster x pod).</li>
      <li><strong>API polling</strong>: add dashboard refresh and automation polling scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If series count dominates, reduce high-cardinality labels or aggregate metrics.</li>
      <li>Spikes often come from new labels in deploys; audit new series creation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/high-cardinality scenarios.</li>
      <li>Forgetting API polling and dashboard refresh costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Active series</th>
          <th>Cardinality</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Expected</td>
          <td>Current</td>
          <td>Normal deploys</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>New labels</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Measure actual custom metric/series counts and alarm/dashboards after rollout.</li>
      <li>Watch API request volume trends (dashboards + automation).</li>
    </ul>
