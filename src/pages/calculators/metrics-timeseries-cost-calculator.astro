  intro="Metrics platforms often charge based on the number of active time series. This calculator estimates monthly cost from your active series count and per‑series pricing."

    "50,000 active series at $0.0005 per series-month → $25/month.",

  includes={[
    "Monthly cost estimate from active time series count and per-series pricing.",
    "Helpful for comparing metric-label cardinality tradeoffs.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Ingestion bytes, retention, and query fees if your provider bills those separately.",
    "Different series definitions across vendors—use your vendor’s definition for inputs.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Monthly cost = active series × price per series-month.",
    "Active series definitions vary by provider (labels, churn window, etc.).",
    "Use this tool for planning and comparisons, then validate in billing docs."

    {
      q: "What counts as a time series?",
      a: "Typically a metric name + a unique set of labels/tags. The exact definition depends on the platform."

      q: "How do I reduce series count?",
      a: "Reduce high-cardinality labels, drop noisy metrics, and aggregate where possible."
