  examples={[
    "10 instances at your $/hour with 100% uptime -> estimate monthly compute cost.",
    "Use lower uptime for dev/test workloads to avoid over-budgeting.",

  excludes={[
    "Storage (EBS), data transfer, and load balancer costs (model separately).",
    "Spot interruptions and autoscaling dynamics unless you use blended assumptions.",

  how={[
    "Monthly cost = instances x $/hour x hours/month x uptime.",
    "If you use commitments (Savings Plans/Reserved), use a blended effective $/hour.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
    </ul>
