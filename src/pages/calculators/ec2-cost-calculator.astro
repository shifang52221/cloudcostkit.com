    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Instances</strong>: use average running instances from billing (instance-hours / monthly hours).</li>
      <li><strong>Hourly rate</strong>: use a blended $/hour if you mix on-demand, Savings Plans, or RIs.</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule</strong>: hours/day and days/month should reflect real uptime windows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using peak instance count as baseline.</li>
      <li>Applying both utilization and reduced hours/day for the same schedule.</li>
      <li>Forgetting storage, transfer, and load balancer line items.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare instance-hours and effective $/hour to billing line items.</li>
      <li>Check average instance count in metrics or inventory data.</li>
    </ul>
