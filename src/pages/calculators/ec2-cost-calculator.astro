  intro="This EC2 cost calculator estimates monthly compute spend from instance count, hourly price, and expected uptime. Use a blended $/hour if you mix on-demand and commitments."
  examples={[
    "10 instances at your $/hour with 100% uptime -> estimate monthly compute cost.",
    "Use lower uptime for dev/test workloads to avoid over-budgeting.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Compute cost estimate from instance count and $/hour pricing assumption.",
    "Uptime modeling to reflect environments that aren't 24/7.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Storage (EBS), data transfer, and load balancer costs (model separately).",
    "Spot interruptions and autoscaling dynamics unless you use blended assumptions.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Monthly cost = instances × $/hour × hours/month × uptime.",
    "If you use commitments (Savings Plans/Reserved), use a blended effective $/hour.",
    "Model storage and transfer as separate line items.",

      a: "A common planning value is ~730 hours/month. Use your billing system's convention if it differs.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I pick a blended $/hour?",
      a: "Use the weighted average you expect to pay across on-demand, commitments, and spot. Validate later with your actual bill.",
