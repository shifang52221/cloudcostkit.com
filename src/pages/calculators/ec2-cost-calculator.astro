    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Instances</strong>: use average running instances from billing (instance-hours / monthly hours).</li>
      <li><strong>Hourly rate</strong>: use a blended $/hour if you mix on-demand, Savings Plans, or RIs.</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule</strong>: hours/day and days/month should reflect real uptime windows.</li>
      <li><strong>Sources</strong>: Cost and Usage Report, instance-hours metrics, or inventory snapshots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If the estimate is far from your bill, check the blended rate and instance-hours first.</li>
      <li>Separate baseline vs bursty workloads to avoid mixing average and peak assumptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using peak instance count as baseline.</li>
      <li>Applying both utilization and reduced hours/day for the same schedule.</li>
      <li>Forgetting storage, transfer, and load balancer line items.</li>
    </ul>
