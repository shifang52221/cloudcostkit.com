  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Do I always pay egress for API Gateway responses?",
      a: "Not always. Transfer pricing depends on where traffic goes (internet, VPC, regions) and your architecture. Use your effective transfer rate for the path that applies.",
    },
    {
      q: "What should I use for average response size?",
      a: "Use the typical compressed payload size over the wire. Large responses can make transfer dominate total cost.",

      q: "How do I reduce API Gateway cost?",
      a: "Reduce request volume (caching, batching), reduce response size, and use a CDN for large payloads when appropriate.",
