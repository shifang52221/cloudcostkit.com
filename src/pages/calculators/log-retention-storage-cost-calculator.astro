  intro="Long retention policies can create big storage bills. This calculator estimates steady-state retained volume and storage cost."
  examples={[
    "50 GB/day logs with 30-day retention → ~1,500 GB retained steady state (before compression).",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Steady-state retained volume estimate (GB/day × retention days).",

  excludes={[
    "Ingestion charges (use Log Ingestion Cost Calculator).",
    "Indexing/query scan charges (use Log Search Scan Cost Calculator).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Retained volume (steady state) ≈ GB/day × retention days.",
    "Monthly storage cost = retained GB × storage price per GB-month.",
    "This is a simplified model; provider billing may differ by compression, indexing, and tiers."

    {
      q: "Why steady state?",
      a: "After you’ve been logging for longer than your retention window, the dataset size is roughly constant: the last N days."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I have multiple log types?",
      a: "Model each log stream separately (app logs, access logs, audit logs), then sum the results."
