  intro="Retention turns a daily log stream into a steady-state stored dataset. This calculator estimates retained GB and monthly storage cost using a simple model: retained GB ≈ GB/day × retention days."
  examples={[
    "50 GB/day with 30-day retention → ~1,500 GB retained steady-state (before vendor-specific compression rules).",
    "If you retain 90–365 days, storage often becomes the dominant log line item.",

    "Steady-state retained volume estimate (GB/day × retention days).",
    "Monthly storage estimate from retained GB and $/GB-month.",

  faqs={[

      q: "When does steady-state not apply?",
      a: "During ramp-up (before you've logged for retention days) and when ingestion is highly seasonal. In those cases, model separate months/scenarios.",

    {
      q: "How should I choose retention?",
      a: "Keep a small hot window for troubleshooting (days to weeks), and keep long retention only for high-value audit/security logs.",

      q: "What if my provider has multiple tables with different retention?",
      a: "Treat each table/source as its own stream (GB/day + retention days), then add the results.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">A practical retention policy (by log class)</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>
        <strong>Access/ingress logs</strong>: 7–14 days hot retention (high volume, mostly operational value).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Application logs</strong>: 14–30 days (enough for incident timelines).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Audit/security logs</strong>: 90–365 days (compliance-driven; keep volume controlled).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px">
      If you need long-term retention, consider moving cold logs to cheaper storage and keeping only a small hot window
      indexed/searchable.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to validate</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Validate measured ingestion (GB/day) for your top sources, not a blended average.</li>
      <li>Validate retention settings per table/source (defaults often drift).</li>
      <li>Validate what the vendor bills as “stored GB” (compressed size vs ingested size differs by provider).</li>
    </ul>
