    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Retention defaults that keep costs predictable</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Prod: 7–14 days hot retention, longer only for critical/audit logs.</li>
      <li>Staging: 3–7 days (enough for debugging, not enough to create surprise bills).</li>
      <li>Dev: 1–3 days (noisy logs are common; short retention prevents drift).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px">
      If you must keep logs long-term, archive to cheaper storage and keep only a small hot window indexed.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Volume</strong>: start from measured ingestion (GB/day) if you have it, then convert to monthly/retention where needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention</strong>: decide retention days and model steady-state GB-month.</li>
      <li><strong>Queries</strong>: model scan/query volume if your tool bills by GB scanned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling ingestion but forgetting retention (GB-month) and scan/query costs.</li>
      <li>Keeping noisy logs forever instead of setting explicit retention tiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Check ingestion GB/day and retention GB-month after changes.</li>
      <li>Check query scan GB and dashboard refresh frequency (common hidden driver).</li>
    </ul>
