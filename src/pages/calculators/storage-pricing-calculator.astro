  intro="Object storage pricing usually comes from three buckets: (1) stored GB (GB-month), (2) request fees (GET/PUT/LIST), and (3) data egress. This page helps you estimate the first two directly, plus a simple egress estimate if you want a fuller picture."
  examples={[
    "5,000 GB stored at $0.023/GB-month -> ~$115/month (storage only). Add request fees if you do millions of requests.",
    "20 TB stored with low request volume -> storage dominates; egress may dominate if you download a lot.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Storage estimate from average stored GB and $/GB-month pricing.",
    "Request fees estimate for GET/PUT (and similar) using per-1k pricing.",
    "Optional egress estimate from GB/month and $/GB pricing.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Lifecycle transitions, retrieval fees, and tiered/region pricing unless you model them with blended rates.",
    "Replication costs (use Storage Replication and Cross-region Transfer calculators).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Storage cost = average stored GB x $/GB-month.",
    "Request cost = (requests / 1,000) x $ per 1,000 (per request class).",
    "Egress cost (optional) = GB/month downloaded x $/GB.",
    "For tiered or regional pricing, use effective blended rates or run scenarios and sum."
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why do you use average stored GB?",
      a: "Storage is billed per GB-month. If usage grows over time, average (midpoint) is closer than end-of-month GB.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do requests matter?",
      a: "Often they're small, but at very high request volume (or many small objects), request fees can be material.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is egress part of storage pricing?",
      a: "Sometimes egress is the biggest cost. This page includes an optional egress estimate; model replication and cross-region separately.",
