  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Do all EBS volume types charge for IOPS and throughput?",
      a: "No. Some volume types include baseline performance and only charge for storage, while others bill separately for provisioned performance. Use $0 for components that don't apply to your plan.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include snapshots?",
      a: "No. Snapshots are typically billed as separate storage. Model them separately if you take frequent snapshots or keep long retention.",
    },
    {
      q: "How should I estimate GB-month?",
      a: "Use the average allocated storage (or average used, depending on billing). If storage grows over time, model multiple months or scenarios.",
