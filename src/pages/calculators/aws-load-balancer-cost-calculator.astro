    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Load balancers</strong>: count active ALBs/NLBs (idle LBs still bill).</li>
      <li><strong>Capacity units</strong>: use average LCU/NLCU per hour from metrics, not monthly totals.</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule</strong>: hours/day and days/month should match actual uptime.</li>
      <li><strong>Pricing</strong>: use region-specific LB-hour and LCU/NLCU-hour rates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If usage share is high, focus on reducing LCU/NLCU drivers (connections, bytes, rule evals).</li>
      <li>If fixed costs dominate, review the number of active load balancers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
      <li>Entering LCU-hours/month as LCU per hour (overstates costs).</li>
      <li>Ignoring idle LBs that stay billed even with no traffic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>LB count</th>
          <th>Capacity units</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Current</td>
          <td>Average</td>
          <td>Normal traffic</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>Current</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>Launch or incident</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
      <li>Compare LB-hours and LCU/NLCU-hours with billing line items.</li>
    </ul>
