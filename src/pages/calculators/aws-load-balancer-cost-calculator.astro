  intro="Estimate load balancer cost with a simple model: fixed hourly LB fees + capacity-unit hours (LCU for ALB or NLCU for NLB). Use your effective region pricing."
  examples={[
    "2 load balancers running 730 hours/month, averaging 5 capacity units/hour — estimate fixed + usage components.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Fixed cost from load balancers × hours/month × $/LB-hour.",
    "Usage cost from capacity unit-hours × $ per unit-hour (LCU/NLCU).",

  excludes={[
    "Data transfer/egress beyond what is included in your provider’s capacity unit definition.",
    "Downstream service costs (instances, NAT, logs, etc).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Fixed cost = load balancers × hours per month × $ per LB-hour.",
    "Capacity unit-hours = avg capacity units per hour × hours per month.",
    "Usage cost = capacity unit-hours × $ per capacity unit-hour.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What should I enter as “capacity units per hour”?",
      a: "Use your measured LCU-hours (ALB) or NLCU-hours (NLB) and enter the average units per hour. If you only have peak values, model both typical and peak scenarios.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include cross-zone or internet egress charges?",
      a: "Not explicitly. Some architectures have separate transfer fees. Model transfer separately if it’s meaningful for your workload.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I reduce load balancer cost?",
      a: "Reduce the number of LBs, reduce capacity units (requests/connections/bytes), and avoid architectures that create excessive east-west traffic.",
