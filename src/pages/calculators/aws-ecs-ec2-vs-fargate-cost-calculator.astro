  intro="Compare ECS on EC2 (instances x $/hour) vs ECS on Fargate (vCPU-hours + GB-hours) using average running capacity. This is compute-only; add load balancers, logs, and data transfer for a full ECS model."
  examples={[
    "ECS service: average 6 tasks at 0.5 vCPU and 1 GB running 730 hours/month vs 3 EC2 instances at $0.18/hr.",
    "ECS on EC2 often wins when instances are packed and covered by commitments; Fargate can win when idle capacity dominates.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Compute-only comparison: EC2 instance-hours vs Fargate vCPU-hours + GB-hours.",
    "Side-by-side monthly totals and differences.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Load balancers (ALB/NLB), NAT/egress, and cross-AZ transfer.",
    "Logs/metrics ingestion and retention.",
    "EBS storage and snapshots (often relevant for ECS on EC2).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Fargate compute = tasks x vCPU x hours x $/vCPU-hour + tasks x memory(GB) x hours x $/GB-hour.",
    "EC2 compute = instances x hours x $/instance-hour.",
    "Compare compute-only totals, then add networking + logs + load balancers for full ECS TCO.",
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why is this labeled compute-only?",
      a: "For ECS workloads, ALBs/NLBs, NAT/egress, and logs can be major line items. This calculator isolates compute so you can compare the baseline first.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I choose average tasks and average instances?",
      a: "Use monthly averages, not peak. If you only know peak, estimate an average from traffic shape and validate later with monitoring.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I use a blended EC2 $/hour?",
      a: "Yes if you use Savings Plans/Reserved Instances. A blended effective rate makes comparisons more realistic.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
    </ul>
