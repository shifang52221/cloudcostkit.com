  intro="Kubernetes costs are mostly compute. A practical first estimate is: (1) size nodes from CPU/memory requests, then (2) multiply by a per-node hourly rate. This page walks you through both steps."
  examples={[
    "Start from pod requests to estimate node count; then multiply by $/hour to get a monthly estimate.",
    "If memory limits node count, memory is the bottleneck even when CPU looks low.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Requests/limits sizing into cluster totals and node estimate.",
    "Node cost estimate from node count, $/hour, and expected uptime.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Control plane fees, load balancers, storage, observability, and egress (add separately).",
    "Bin packing constraints (affinities, max pods per node) that can increase node count.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Step 1: Convert per-pod requests into total CPU/memory and an estimated node count.",
    "Step 2: Estimate monthly node cost from node count and $/hour pricing.",
    "Add separate line items for managed control plane, storage, load balancers, logs/metrics, and egress."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why estimate from requests, not limits?",
      a: "Scheduling uses requests. Limits matter for throttling/OOM risk but aren't a good baseline for capacity planning.",
    },
    {
      q: "What else should I include in a full Kubernetes cost model?",
      a: "At minimum: control plane, load balancers, persistent volumes, container registry, logs/metrics, and data egress.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do managed control plane fees matter?",
      a: "Often yes. Many managed Kubernetes offerings charge a fixed hourly control plane fee. Add it as a separate line item.",
    },
    {
      q: "How should I think about autoscaling?",
      a: "Use average (typical) node count for budgeting, and check peak node count for risk. A blended utilization/uptime assumption is usually more accurate than using peak 24/7.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I use on-demand, spot, or commitments?",
      a: "Use the effective blended $/hour you actually expect to pay. If you mix on-demand + savings plans/reserved instances + spot, compute a blended rate and test sensitivity.",

      This Kubernetes cost calculator focuses on the biggest driver: node spend. Treat the result as a baseline, then
