  intro="Requests drive scheduling. This tool converts per-pod requests into cluster totals and estimates how many nodes you need for those requests given an allocatable overhead."
  examples={[
    "60 pods with 250m CPU and 512Mi requests → estimate total requests and node count for an 8 vCPU / 32 GiB node.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Totals for CPU/memory requests and limits from per-pod values and pod count.",
    "Node count estimate based on allocatable percentage (headroom).",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Bin packing constraints (pods per node limits, affinities, taints) and daemonset overhead.",
    "Network, storage, and control plane costs.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Total requests = pods × per-pod request (CPU and memory).",
    "Allocatable per node = node capacity × allocatable percentage.",
    "Node estimate uses the larger of CPU-based and memory-based counts."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why not size based on limits?",
      a: "Scheduling uses requests, not limits. Limits matter for bursting risk and potential throttling/OOM behavior."
    },
    {
      q: "What should I use for allocatable %?",
      a: "A common planning value is 85–95% depending on kubelet/system reservations, daemonsets, and headroom."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include per-node overhead like daemonsets?",
      a: "Not explicitly. Use a lower allocatable % or increase requests to account for overhead."
