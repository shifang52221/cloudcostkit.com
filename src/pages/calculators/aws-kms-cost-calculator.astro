    {
      q: "Why can KMS costs be higher than expected?",
      a: "KMS requests can be generated by many services (storage encryption, database encryption, secrets access). High-frequency operations and chatty workloads can create very large request volume.",

      q: "What's the fastest way to reduce KMS spend?",
      a: "Reduce request volume: avoid per-request encryption in hot paths when not needed, use envelope encryption appropriately, and fix retry loops that amplify KMS calls.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
    </ul>
