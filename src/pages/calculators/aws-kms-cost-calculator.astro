  intro="Estimate KMS-style costs with a simple model: customer managed key-months plus request charges. Use your effective region pricing and your request volume."
  examples={[
    "50 keys at $1/key-month and 300M requests/month at $0.03 per 10k requests.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Key-month charges from key count and $/key-month.",
    "Request charges from requests/month and $ per 10k requests.",

  excludes={[
    "Multi-region keys and custom key stores unless modeled separately.",
    "Downstream service charges that generate KMS requests (S3, EBS, RDS, etc.).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Key cost = keys x $ per key-month.",
    "Request cost = (requests per month / 10,000) x $ per 10k requests.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why can KMS costs be higher than expected?",
      a: "KMS requests can be generated by many services (storage encryption, database encryption, secrets access). High-frequency operations and chatty workloads can create very large request volume.",
    },
    {
      q: "What’s the fastest way to reduce KMS spend?",
      a: "Reduce request volume: avoid per-request encryption in hot paths when not needed, use envelope encryption appropriately, and fix retry loops that amplify KMS calls.",
