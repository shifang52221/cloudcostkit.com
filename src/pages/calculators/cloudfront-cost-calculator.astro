  intro="This CloudFront cost calculator helps you estimate two common CDN line items: bandwidth and requests. Plug in your own $/GB and $ per 10k assumptions, then add them to get a monthly estimate."
  examples={[
    "Bandwidth: 10,000 GB/month at your $/GB + Requests: 400M/month at your $ per 10k -> estimate monthly CDN cost.",
    "If your workload has many small objects, request fees can become a meaningful part of the bill.",

  includes={[
    "Bandwidth estimate from GB/month and $/GB pricing assumptions.",
    "Request-fee estimate from requests/month and $ per 10k pricing assumptions.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Origin egress and cache fill costs (model separately if billed).",
    "Tiered pricing by region unless you use a blended rate or model scenarios.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Total = bandwidth cost + request fees.",
    "Bandwidth cost = GB/month × $/GB.",
    "Request fees = (requests/month ÷ 10,000) × $ per 10k.",
    "If pricing is tiered, use a blended rate or run multiple scenarios and sum."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is this an official CloudFront quote?",
      a: "No. It’s a planning estimate based on the assumptions you enter. Always confirm pricing tiers, regions, and units in the official documentation.",
    },
    {
      q: "What inputs do I need?",
      a: "Monthly GB delivered to users and monthly request volume. If you only have throughput or RPS, convert them using the Units Converter and RPS-to-monthly tool.",
