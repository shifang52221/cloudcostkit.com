    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Volume</strong>: start from measured ingestion (GB/day) if you have it, then convert to monthly/retention where needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention</strong>: decide retention days and model steady-state GB-month.</li>
      <li><strong>Queries</strong>: model scan/query volume if your tool bills by GB scanned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If scans dominate, reduce query time ranges and pre-filter noisy fields.</li>
      <li>If incident spikes dominate, limit dashboard refresh during outages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling ingestion but forgetting retention (GB-month) and scan/query costs.</li>
      <li>Keeping noisy logs forever instead of setting explicit retention tiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>GB scanned/day</th>
          <th>Query frequency</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Expected</td>
          <td>Normal</td>
          <td>Daily dashboards</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>Incident queries</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Check ingestion GB/day and retention GB-month after changes.</li>
      <li>Check query scan GB and dashboard refresh frequency (common hidden driver).</li>
    </ul>
