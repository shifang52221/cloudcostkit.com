      q: "Do alarms include metric costs?",
      a: "No. Metrics are typically billed separately. If you create many custom metrics or have high-cardinality labels, metrics can dominate the total observability bill.",

      q: "What’s a common reason alarm bills grow unexpectedly?",
      a: "Alarm sprawl: duplicated alarms across environments, per-tenant/per-pod alarms, and high-resolution alarms enabled broadly.",
