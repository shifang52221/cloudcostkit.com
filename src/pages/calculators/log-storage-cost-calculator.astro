  intro="If you’re searching for log storage costs, retention is usually the driver. This calculator estimates the steady-state retained log storage and its monthly cost from GB/day, retention days, and a $/GB-month pricing assumption."
  examples={[
    "50 GB/day retained for 30 days -> ~1,500 GB retained steady-state; apply $/GB-month to estimate storage cost.",
    "High retention (90–365 days) often dominates storage cost even when daily ingest is flat.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Retained log storage estimate from GB/day and retention days.",
    "Monthly storage cost estimate from retained GB and $/GB-month pricing.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Ingestion charges (model separately if billed).",
    "Search/scan charges and indexing add-ons (model separately).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Retained GB (steady-state) ≈ GB/day × retention days.",
    "Monthly storage cost = retained GB × $/GB-month.",
    "If retention varies by log type, model each type separately and sum."
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why is retention the main driver?",
      a: "Storage is billed over time (GB-month). Longer retention multiplies steady-state stored GB even when ingest is constant.",
    },
    {
      q: "What if I use multiple retention tiers?",
      a: "Split your logs into tiers (e.g., 7 days hot + 90 days archive), estimate each tier separately with different $/GB-month rates, and add them up.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does compression reduce billed GB?",
      a: "It depends on the vendor. Some bill based on compressed stored size; others bill based on ingested volume. Check your provider’s billing definition.",
