  intro="If you're searching for log storage costs, retention is usually the driver. This calculator estimates the steady-state retained log storage and its monthly cost from GB/day, retention days, and a $/GB-month pricing assumption."
  examples={[
    "50 GB/day retained for 30 days -> ~1,500 GB retained steady-state; apply $/GB-month to estimate storage cost.",
    "High retention (90-365 days) often dominates storage cost even when daily ingest is flat.",

  excludes={[
    "Ingestion charges (model separately if billed).",
    "Search/scan charges and indexing add-ons (model separately).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Retained GB (steady-state) ~ GB/day x retention days.",
    "Monthly storage cost = retained GB x $/GB-month.",
    "If retention varies by log type, model each type separately and sum."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why is retention the main driver?",
      a: "Storage is billed over time (GB-month). Longer retention multiplies steady-state stored GB even when ingest is constant.",
    },
    {
      q: "What if I use multiple retention tiers?",
      a: "Split your logs into tiers (e.g., 7 days hot + 90 days archive), estimate each tier separately with different $/GB-month rates, and add them up.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does compression reduce billed GB?",
      a: "It depends on the vendor. Some bill based on compressed stored size; others bill based on ingested volume. Check your provider's billing definition.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Retention tiers (hot vs cold) — a practical model</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:8px">
      If you keep “hot” logs for fast search and “cold” logs for compliance, model them as separate tiers with different
      retention days and different $/GB-month rates.
    </p>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Hot tier: 7–14 days for troubleshooting and dashboards.</li>
      <li>Cold tier: 90–365 days for audits and investigations (often cheaper storage).</li>
      <li>Only index what you search; indexing everything is a common hidden multiplier.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Volume</strong>: start from measured ingestion (GB/day) if you have it, then convert to monthly/retention where needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention</strong>: decide retention days and model steady-state GB-month.</li>
      <li><strong>Queries</strong>: model scan/query volume if your tool bills by GB scanned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling ingestion but forgetting retention (GB-month) and scan/query costs.</li>
      <li>Keeping noisy logs forever instead of setting explicit retention tiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Check ingestion GB/day and retention GB-month after changes.</li>
      <li>Check query scan GB and dashboard refresh frequency (common hidden driver).</li>
    </ul>
