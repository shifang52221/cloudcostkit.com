      q: "Do I need to include origin egress?",
      a: "Sometimes. If your CDN pulls from an origin you pay for, cache fill and origin egress can be material. Model origin egress separately with the Data Egress calculator.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">1) Bandwidth</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:8px">
      Use monthly GB delivered by the CDN to end users (edge bandwidth). If you only have Mbps, convert it to GB/month
      with the Units Converter or this guide: <a href="/guides/estimate-cdn-bandwidth-gb-per-month/">estimate CDN bandwidth</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:8px">
      This calculator is intentionally simple: bring your own pricing assumptions, then sanity-check the result against
      provider billable units (GB vs GiB, per-10k vs per-1M requests, region tiers).

    <h2>2) Requests</h2>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:8px">
      Some providers charge per request (often per 10k or per 1M). If you have RPS, convert it to requests/month first.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:8px">
      Use <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to Monthly Requests</a> if you start from traffic
      charts rather than a billing export. For pricing units and conversion tips, read{" "}

    <h2>3) Common pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Mixing GB and GiB (use <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units converter</a>).</li>
      <li>Using origin egress as a proxy for CDN edge bandwidth (they are different line items).</li>
      <li>Ignoring request-class pricing (static vs dynamic, cache miss vs hit) when it matters.</li>
      <li>Forgetting cache fill traffic and origin egress when your hit rate is low.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px">
      If you are comparing providers, use the same traffic inputs and swap pricing assumptions. This checklist helps:

  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
    </ul>
