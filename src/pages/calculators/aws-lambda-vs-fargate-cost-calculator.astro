  intro="Compare Lambda (requests + GB-seconds) vs Fargate (vCPU-hours + GB-hours) using your own pricing inputs. This is a compute-only comparison; add logs, transfer, and load balancers for full TCO."
  examples={[
    "50M requests/month at 120 ms and 512 MB vs 3 tasks running 24/7 at 0.5 vCPU and 1 GB.",
    "For steady high-throughput workloads, Fargate often wins; for bursty spiky workloads, Lambda often wins.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Lambda request cost and compute cost (GB-seconds) with optional free tier.",
    "Fargate vCPU-hour and memory GB-hour compute costs from average running tasks.",
    "Side-by-side monthly totals and differences.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Logs/metrics costs (often meaningful for services with high volume).",
    "Networking costs (NAT, egress, cross-AZ/cross-region transfer).",
    "Load balancers, retries/timeouts, and ancillary services.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Lambda: request cost + (duration × memory) GB-seconds × $/GB-second (minus free tier if enabled).",
    "Fargate: tasks × vCPU × hours × $/vCPU-hour + tasks × memory(GB) × hours × $/GB-hour.",
    "Compare the compute-only monthly totals, then add other line items in your overall model.",
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is this an official AWS quote?",
      a: "No. This is a simplified estimate for planning. Verify region pricing, free tier, rounding rules, and service add-ons in AWS documentation.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why does the winner change by workload shape?",
      a: "Lambda pricing is execution-based and can be cheaper when traffic is bursty or idle often. Fargate pricing is capacity × time and can be cheaper for steady utilization and long-running compute.",
    },
    {
      q: "What should I model next after compute?",
      a: "Add logs, networking (egress/NAT/cross-AZ), and load balancers. For many services, these line items can be comparable to compute.",
