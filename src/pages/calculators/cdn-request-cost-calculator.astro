  examples={[
    "300,000,000 requests/month at $0.0075 per 10k requests is about $225/month.",
    "1.2B requests/month at $0.01 per 10k requests is about $1,200/month.",

  includes={[
    "Request-fee estimate from requests/month and $ per 10k requests pricing.",
    "Useful for comparing CDN plans where requests are billed separately.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Bandwidth costs (use CDN Bandwidth Cost Calculator).",
    "Different request classes (e.g., dynamic vs static) unless you model separately.",

  how={[
    "Request cost = (requests per month / 10,000) x price per 10k requests.",
    "Use the price and request class that matches your CDN billing model.",
    "This tool estimates request fees only (not bandwidth).",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Do all CDNs charge request fees?",
      a: "No. Some products include requests or have different tiers/classes. Always check the pricing page for your plan."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I estimate request volume?",
      a: "Use CDN analytics, load balancer metrics, or convert from RPS using the RPS to Monthly Requests tool."
    },
    {
      q: "Are cache hits and cache misses billed differently?",
      a: "Some providers price different request types/classes (static vs dynamic, cache miss vs hit). If your pricing differs, estimate each class separately."
    },
    {
      q: "Does HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 change request count?",
      a: "Transport protocols can change connection behavior, but billing is usually based on requests rather than connections. Use your CDN's definition of a billable request."
