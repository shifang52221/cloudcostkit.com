      q: "How do I estimate request volume?",
      a: "Use CDN analytics, load balancer metrics, or convert from RPS using the RPS to Monthly Requests tool."

      q: "Are cache hits and cache misses billed differently?",
      a: "Some providers price different request types/classes (static vs dynamic, cache miss vs hit). If your pricing differs, estimate each class separately."

      q: "Does HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 change request count?",
      a: "Transport protocols can change connection behavior, but billing is usually based on requests rather than connections. Use your CDN's definition of a billable request."

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What to split into separate scenarios (request classes)</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li><strong>Static vs dynamic</strong>: some CDNs price them differently.</li>
      <li><strong>Cache hit vs miss</strong>: misses also create origin load and origin egress.</li>
      <li><strong>Regions</strong>: if pricing varies by geography, model your top regions separately and add them up.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px">
      Use the Pricing unit selector in the calculator to enter $/10k or $/1M directly (it keeps the same effective rate).

  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">When request fees spike</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:10px 0 0; padding-left:18px">
      <li><strong>Bot traffic</strong>: more requests with little bandwidth change.</li>
      <li><strong>Chatty clients</strong>: many small API calls per page view.</li>
      <li><strong>Cache busting</strong>: query-string churn and low TTLs can increase request volume.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Requests scale with cache misses, bot traffic, and chatty clients.</li>
      <li>If request fees dominate, focus on caching and request consolidation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Requests</th>
          <th>Class</th>

    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
