  intro="Estimate Secrets Manager-style cost with a simple model: secret-month charges plus API request charges. Use your effective region pricing and your measured API call volume."
  examples={[
    "500 secrets at $0.40/secret-month and 300M API calls/month at $0.05 per 10k calls.",

    "Secret-month baseline from secrets count and $ per secret-month.",

  excludes={[
    "Rotation workflows and downstream service costs (Lambda, databases, etc.) unless modeled separately.",
    "Fine-grained pricing nuances; use your effective blended rates.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Secret cost = secrets x $ per secret-month.",
    "API cost = (API calls per month / 10,000) x $ per 10k calls.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why do Secrets Manager costs spike?",
      a: "Most spikes are request-driven: applications calling GetSecretValue frequently (per request), many pods/instances starting frequently, or retry loops causing repeated secret fetches.",
    },
    {
      q: "What’s the fastest lever to reduce cost?",
      a: "Reduce API calls by caching secrets in memory with safe refresh, and avoid fetching secrets on every request.",
