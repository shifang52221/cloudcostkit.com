      a: "No. Snapshot storage is incremental and depends on real change patterns. This is a planning estimate to avoid under-budgeting.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily change rate drives growth; small increases compound quickly with longer retention.</li>
      <li>Large one-time churn (rebuilds, reindexing) should be modeled as peak months.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Daily change</th>
          <th>Retention</th>
          <th>Stored GB</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Typical</td>
          <td>Standard</td>
          <td>Estimated</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>Same</td>
          <td>Higher</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
    </ul>
