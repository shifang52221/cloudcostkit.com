  intro="Estimate EBS snapshot storage cost using a simplified steady-state model: full volume + daily changed data retained over the retention window."
  examples={[
    "1,000 GB volume, 2% daily changes, 30-day retention -> estimate stored GB and monthly cost.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Snapshot stored volume estimate (steady state) from volume + change rate + retention.",
    "Monthly snapshot storage cost estimate from stored GB and $/GB-month.",

  excludes={[
    "Provider-specific snapshot optimizations, rounding rules, and compression behavior.",
    "Data transfer, requests, and restore fees if applicable.",

  how={[
    "Daily changed GB = volume GB × daily change rate.",
    "Estimated stored GB ≈ volume GB + daily changed GB × (retention days − 1).",
    "Monthly cost ≈ stored GB × $/GB-month.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is this exact?",
      a: "No. Snapshot storage is incremental and depends on real change patterns. This is a planning estimate to avoid under-budgeting.",
    },
    {
      q: "What daily change rate should I use?",
      a: "Start with measured churn (writes) if you have it. If unsure, model scenarios (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%) and validate later.",
    },
    {
      q: "What else should I model for EBS?",
      a: "EBS volume storage plus performance add-ons (IOPS/throughput on some types), plus snapshot storage and retention policy.",
