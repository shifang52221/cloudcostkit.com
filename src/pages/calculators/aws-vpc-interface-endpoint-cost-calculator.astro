  intro="Estimate VPC Interface Endpoint (PrivateLink) cost using a simple model: endpoint-hours (endpoints x AZs x hours) + data processed (GB). Use your effective region pricing."
  examples={[
    "3 interface endpoints across 2 AZs running 730 hours/month, processing 2,000 GB/month.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Endpoint-hours from endpoints x AZs x hours/month x $ per endpoint-hour.",
    "Data processing from GB/month x $ per GB processed.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Other VPC data transfer line items (cross-AZ/cross-region) depending on your path.",
    "Service-specific pricing differences and tiered steps unless you reflect them in your inputs.",

  how={[
    "Endpoint-hours = endpoints x AZs per endpoint x hours/month.",
    "Hourly cost = endpoint-hours x $ per endpoint-hour.",
    "Data processing cost = GB processed/month x $ per GB processed.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What should I use for AZs per endpoint?",
      a: "Use the number of Availability Zones where you attach the endpoint. Many teams deploy in 2 or 3 AZs for resiliency, which multiplies endpoint-hours.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I estimate data processed (GB)?",
      a: "Start from the traffic you currently send through NAT to AWS services and estimate how much will move to endpoints. Use flow logs/metrics when possible, or model a few scenarios.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does this replace the NAT bill?",
      a: "Not automatically. Endpoints can reduce NAT GB processed for compatible services, but you should model both before and after to find the break-even point.",
