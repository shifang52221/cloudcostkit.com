      q: "Does this replace the NAT bill?",
      a: "Not automatically. Endpoints can reduce NAT GB processed for compatible services, but you should model both before and after to find the break-even point.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Interface endpoints</strong>: count distinct interface endpoints you plan to deploy (often by AWS service).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AZs per endpoint</strong>: this is the main multiplier (2 vs 3 AZs changes endpoint-hours materially).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GB processed</strong>: estimate how much NAT traffic to AWS services will shift to endpoints (use flow logs
        or model scenarios).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Forgetting that interface endpoints are per AZ (endpoint-hours scale with AZ count).</li>
      <li>Creating endpoint sprawl across environments without ownership/lifecycle.</li>
      <li>Moving traffic across AZ boundaries and creating transfer charges elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after rollout</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify NAT GB processed decreases for the targeted destinations.</li>
      <li>Verify endpoint-hours match your endpoint x AZ deployment.</li>
      <li>Check cross-AZ transfer trends after routing changes.</li>
    </ul>
