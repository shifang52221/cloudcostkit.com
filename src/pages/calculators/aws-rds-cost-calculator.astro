    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Compute</strong>: instance-hours from billing (hours/day x days/month) or average serverless capacity.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage</strong>: average allocated or used GB-month and expected growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Backups</strong>: retention x daily change rate to estimate backup GB-month.</li>
      <li><strong>I/O</strong>: use engine metrics or billing for I/O request volume.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If backups are a large share, review retention and snapshot lifecycle policies.</li>
      <li>If I/O is dominant, evaluate storage type and workload patterns before scaling instance size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignoring backup storage growth and retention creep.</li>
      <li>Using allocated storage as a constant without growth assumptions.</li>
      <li>Forgetting I/O pricing for engines that charge per request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Instances</th>
          <th>Storage</th>
          <th>Backups</th>
          <th>I/O</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

        <tr>

          <td>Expected</td>
          <td>Average</td>
          <td>Retention plan</td>
          <td>Normal workload</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>Same or +1</td>

          <td>Higher churn</td>
          <td>Batch/backfill</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare instance-hours, storage, backups, and I/O to actual RDS line items.</li>
      <li>Re-check during batch jobs or backfills when churn spikes.</li>
    </ul>
