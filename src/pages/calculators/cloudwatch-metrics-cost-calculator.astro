  intro="Estimate CloudWatch Metrics-style cost with a simple model: custom metrics + alarms + dashboards + API requests. Use your effective region pricing."
  examples={[
    "2,000 custom metrics, 150 alarms, 5 dashboards, and 10M API requests per month.",

    "Custom metrics (metric-month) estimate.",

    {
      q: "Is time series cardinality the same as custom metrics?",
      a: "They are related but not identical. High-cardinality dimensions can create many unique series/metrics. Use your provider’s definition and measure your actual counts when possible.",

    {
      q: "What should I use for API requests?",
      a: "Use your monitoring/export workload (GetMetricData, GetMetricStatistics, dashboards, and automation). If you don't know yet, start with a small value and model a high-usage scenario.",

      q: "How do I reduce CloudWatch Metrics costs?",
      a: "Reduce custom metric count (especially high-cardinality dimensions), delete unused alarms and dashboards, and reduce API polling/query frequency.",
