  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What should I count as a rule?",
      a: "Count the rules you evaluate: custom rules plus managed rule groups you enable (based on how your pricing counts them). If unsure, start with your configured total and refine.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why does cost spike during an attack?",
      a: "Because request charges scale with total requests evaluated. Spikes in traffic (legitimate or malicious) can increase request-based cost and also downstream logging/analysis costs.",
    },
    {
      q: "How can I reduce WAF cost?",
      a: "Reduce evaluated requests (CDN caching, rate limiting, blocking early) and keep rule count tight. Also control downstream logging/analysis volume.",

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Requests</strong>: estimate evaluated requests/month (include blocked traffic).</li>
      <li><strong>Baselines</strong>: count ACLs and rules as billed in your pricing model.</li>
      <li><strong>Downstream</strong>: add logging/storage/analytics volume as a second bill.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>ACL and rule counts are steady; request volume drives spikes.</li>
      <li>If costs jump, verify bot traffic and retries before changing rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Budgeting steady traffic but ignoring attack/bot surge scenarios.</li>
      <li>Forgetting downstream log/scan costs that can exceed the WAF line item.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>ACLs</th>
          <th>Rules</th>
          <th>Requests</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Configured</td>
          <td>Configured</td>
          <td>Expected</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>Same</td>
          <td>Same</td>
          <td>Attack/bot spike</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Track evaluated request volume and rule/ACL sprawl over time.</li>
      <li>Check downstream log ingestion and scan/query costs during incidents.</li>
    </ul>
