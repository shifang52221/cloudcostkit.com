  intro="Once you know your node count and per-node hourly price, you can estimate monthly spend quickly. Use utilization and hours/day to model non-24/7 clusters."
  examples={[
    "12 nodes at $0.32/hour running 24/7 -> estimate monthly node spend.",
    "6 nodes at $0.25/hour running 10 hours/day on weekdays -> model dev environment spend.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Monthly compute estimate from node count, $/hour, and billable hours.",
    "Simple utilization model for scheduled/dev environments.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Load balancers, storage, bandwidth, control plane fees, and add-ons.",
    "Autoscaling dynamics (use multiple scenarios).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Billable hours per node ~= days per month x hours/day x utilization.",
    "Monthly cost = nodes x billable hours per node x $/hour.",
    "This tool estimates node compute only (not load balancers, storage, or data transfer)."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Should I use on-demand or committed hourly pricing?",
      a: "Use the effective hourly price you expect after savings plans/reservations if applicable."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include control plane fees?",
      a: "No. Some managed Kubernetes services have control plane charges-add those separately."
    },
    {
      q: "What else should I add for a full Kubernetes cost estimate?",
      a: "Common add-ons include load balancers, persistent volumes, NAT/egress, logging/metrics, and control plane fees. Use this calculator for node compute, then layer the rest as separate line items."
