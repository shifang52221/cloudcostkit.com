    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Baseline RPS</strong>: use CDN/LB/WAF metrics for a normal window.</li>
      <li><strong>Attack RPS</strong>: use incident logs or peak traffic spikes.</li>
      <li><strong>Attack hours</strong>: total duration per month of spikes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Total evaluated requests drive the WAF request charge line item.</li>
      <li>Even short attack windows can dominate monthly request volume.</li>
    </ul>
