    "On-demand $0.12/hr vs committed $0.075/hr with $300 upfront → estimate break-even hours.",

  includes={[
    "Break-even usage estimate from hourly savings and upfront cost.",

  excludes={[
    "Term length, discount rate, and flexibility risk (use a full ROI model for decisions).",
    "Provider-specific commitment utilization constraints.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Hourly savings = on-demand hourly − committed hourly.",
    "Break-even hours = upfront ÷ hourly savings (if savings > 0).",
    "Monthly savings = hourly savings × hours per month (excluding upfront)."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What if committed hourly is higher than on-demand?",
      a: "Then there is no break-even: the commitment is not cheaper under the assumptions provided."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include partial upfront or term length?",
      a: "No. This is a simplified break-even estimate. For a full ROI model, incorporate the term, discount rate, and flexibility risk."
    },
    {
      q: "What should I use for hours per month?",
      a: "730 is a common approximation. If you have non-24/7 workloads, use your expected billable hours."
