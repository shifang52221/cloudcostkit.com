  intro="If you know your request volume and typical response size, you can estimate transfer and then model egress/CDN cost."
  examples={[
    "2,000,000 requests/day with 15 KB average responses ≈ ~870 GB/month (estimate).",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Monthly transfer estimate from requests/day and average response KB.",
    "Useful for quick egress/CDN planning and cost comparisons.",

  excludes={[
    "Protocol overhead, retries, uploads, and request headers.",
    "Compression differences between endpoints (model with your average KB).",

  how={[
    "Requests per month ≈ requests/day × 30.4.",
    "Monthly transfer (GB) ≈ requests/month × average response KB ÷ 1024 ÷ 1024.",
    "This estimate ignores protocol overhead and retries."

      q: "Should I use compressed or uncompressed size?",
      a: "Use the typical size over the wire (compressed) to better estimate bandwidth."

    {
      q: "Does this include uploads?",
      a: "No. This models response payloads. If uploads are significant, model them separately."
