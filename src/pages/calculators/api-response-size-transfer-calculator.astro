  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">What “response size” should include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Payload bytes</strong>: JSON/HTML/media returned by the endpoint (usually the dominant part).</li>
      <li><strong>Compression</strong>: measure the <em>compressed</em> bytes over the wire if you use gzip/brotli.</li>
      <li><strong>Headers</strong>: often small, but can matter if you have many small responses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to measure average response size (without guessing)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>From access logs: average <strong>bytes sent</strong> by route (p50/p95 is better than mean).</li>
      <li>From APM: sample response body sizes for hot endpoints and exclude outliers (large downloads).</li>
      <li>
        Separate “small API” and “large download” endpoints; mixing them produces an average that fits neither.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common multipliers (why bandwidth is higher than payload math)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Retries/timeouts</strong>: incident windows can multiply responses per user action.</li>
      <li><strong>Cache misses</strong>: if every request hits origin, your origin bandwidth follows the full request volume.</li>
      <li><strong>Pagination</strong>: chatty clients that pull many pages inflate transfer quickly.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GB/month</strong>: start from billing exports/flow logs; if you only have throughput, convert Mbps to GB/month.</li>
      <li><strong>Boundaries</strong>: separate cross-AZ vs cross-region vs internet egress as separate line items.</li>
      <li><strong>Effective rates</strong>: use your blended $/GB for the traffic mix you expect.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mixing boundaries and applying the wrong $/GB rate.</li>
      <li>Ignoring retries/timeouts that multiply traffic during incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Validate the top transfer paths and AZ/region locality after architecture changes.</li>
      <li>Re-check during peak windows (that’s when hidden multipliers show up).</li>
    </ul>
