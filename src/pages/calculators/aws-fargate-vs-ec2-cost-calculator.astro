    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fargate</strong>: use average running tasks and task size from ECS metrics and definitions.</li>
      <li><strong>EC2</strong>: use average instance count and a blended $/hour if you mix commitments.</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule</strong>: apply the same hours/day and days/month to both sides.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope</strong>: this is compute-only; add logs, transfer, and load balancers separately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Comparing peak Fargate usage to average EC2 usage (or vice versa).</li>
      <li>Ignoring EC2 packing efficiency and idle capacity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare EC2 instance-hours and Fargate vCPU/GB hours from billing.</li>
      <li>Use a real month of metrics to calibrate the averages.</li>
    </ul>
