  intro="Compare Fargate (vCPU-hours + memory GB-hours) vs EC2 (instances × $/hour) using average running capacity. This is compute-only; add load balancers, logs, and data transfer for a full model."
  examples={[
    "6 tasks at 0.5 vCPU and 1 GB running 730 hours/month vs 3 instances at $0.18/hr.",
    "If EC2 is underutilized, Fargate can be cheaper; if EC2 is packed efficiently with commitments, EC2 often wins.",

  includes={[
    "Fargate compute estimate (vCPU-hours + GB-hours) from average running tasks.",
    "EC2 compute estimate (instance-hours) from average instances and $/instance-hour.",
    "Side-by-side monthly totals and differences.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "EBS storage, data transfer/NAT, load balancers, and other networking costs.",
    "Logs/metrics ingestion and retention costs.",
    "Tiering, discounts, and rounding rules unless you reflect them in inputs.",

  how={[
    "Fargate: tasks × vCPU × hours × $/vCPU-hour + tasks × memory(GB) × hours × $/GB-hour.",
    "EC2: instances × hours × $/instance-hour (use a blended effective rate if you mix commitments).",
    "Compare the compute-only totals, then add other line items in your overall model.",
  ]}
  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is this a full total cost of ownership (TCO) model?",
      a: "No. This compares compute-only costs. In real workloads, load balancers, logs, NAT/egress, and storage can be meaningful.",
    },
    {
      q: "What should I use for average tasks/instances?",
      a: "Use the monthly average running capacity, not peak. If you only know peak, estimate an average from traffic shape and validate later with metrics.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do commitments change the EC2 comparison?",
      a: "If you use Savings Plans/Reserved Instances, your effective EC2 $/hour can be lower. Use a blended rate that matches your expected coverage.",
