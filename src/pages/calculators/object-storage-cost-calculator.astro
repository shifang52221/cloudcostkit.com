  intro="Object storage costs usually come from stored data and request volume. Use this calculator to estimate the blended monthly cost with your workload assumptions."
  examples={[
    "5,000 GB stored, plus 5M GET and 500k PUT requests at your request pricing -> estimate monthly cost.",
    "20 TB stored with low request volume -> storage dominates; requests are usually a rounding error.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Storage cost estimate from average GB stored and $/GB-month pricing.",
    "Request cost estimate for GET and PUT from request counts and per-1k pricing.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Retrieval fees, lifecycle transitions, replication, and tiered pricing (model separately).",
    "Bandwidth/egress charges (use Data Egress Cost Calculator).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Storage cost = average stored GB x storage price per GB-month.",
    "Request cost = (requests / 1,000) x price per 1,000 for each request type.",
    "This simplified model excludes retrieval fees, lifecycle transitions, replication, and tiered pricing."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why use average stored GB?",
      a: "Billing is typically per GB-month. If your storage grows over the month, use the average (midpoint) rather than the end-of-month number."
    },
    {
      q: "Do egress costs belong here?",
      a: "Not in this tool. Use the Data Egress Cost Calculator for bandwidth-based costs."
    },
    {
      q: "What about different storage classes?",
      a: "Different classes (standard, infrequent access, archive) can have different storage, request, and retrieval pricing. Model each class separately if needed."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I estimate replication or cross-region copy costs?",
      a: "Replication/copy can add per-GB and/or transfer fees, plus extra replica storage. Use the Storage Replication calculator for the replication fee and add replica storage here as another line item."
    },
    {
      q: "Do small objects increase cost?",
      a: "Many small objects often increase request volume (PUT/LIST/GET), which can increase request fees. If you store millions of small objects, request costs can become material."
