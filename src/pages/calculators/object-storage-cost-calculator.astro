  intro="Object storage costs usually come from stored data and request volume. Use this calculator to estimate the blended monthly cost and compare baseline vs peak traffic."
  examples={[
    "5,000 GB stored, plus 5M GET and 500k PUT requests at your request pricing -> estimate monthly cost.",
    "20 TB stored with low request volume -> storage dominates; requests are usually a rounding error.",
    "Peak 220% scenario shows how request surges impact total cost."
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Storage cost estimate from average GB stored and $/GB-month pricing.",
    "Request cost estimate for GET and PUT from request counts and per-1k pricing.",
    "Baseline vs peak scenario table for request spikes.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Retrieval fees, lifecycle transitions, replication, and tiered pricing (model separately).",
    "Bandwidth/egress charges (use Data Egress Cost Calculator).",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Storage cost = average stored GB x storage price per GB-month.",
    "Request cost = (requests / 1,000) x price per 1,000 for each request type.",
    "This simplified model excludes retrieval fees, lifecycle transitions, replication, and tiered pricing."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why use average stored GB?",
      a: "Billing is typically per GB-month. If your storage grows over the month, use the average (midpoint) rather than the end-of-month number."
    },
    {
      q: "Do egress costs belong here?",
      a: "Not in this tool. Use the Data Egress Cost Calculator for bandwidth-based costs."
    },
    {
      q: "What about different storage classes?",
      a: "Different classes (standard, infrequent access, archive) can have different storage, request, and retrieval pricing. Model each class separately if needed."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I estimate replication or cross-region copy costs?",
      a: "Replication/copy can add per-GB and/or transfer fees, plus extra replica storage. Use the Storage Replication calculator for the replication fee and add replica storage here as another line item."
    },
    {
      q: "Do small objects increase cost?",
      a: "Many small objects often increase request volume (PUT/LIST/GET), which can increase request fees. If you store millions of small objects, request costs can become material."

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: use billing exports, metrics, or logs to get real counts/GB where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong>: convert throughput (Mbps) or rates (RPS) into monthly units when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: build a baseline and a high-usage scenario to avoid under-budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Storage GB-month is steady; requests spike during traffic bursts or batch jobs.</li>
      <li>If requests dominate, review object size and access patterns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a single average and ignoring peak/incident scenarios.</li>
      <li>Double-counting or missing adjacent line items (transfer, logs, retries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Stored GB</th>
          <th>GET/PUT</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Average</td>
          <td>Expected</td>
          <td>Normal traffic</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>Same</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>Batch/launch</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare your estimate to the first real bill and adjust assumptions.</li>
      <li>Track the primary driver metric (requests/GB/count) over time.</li>
    </ul>
