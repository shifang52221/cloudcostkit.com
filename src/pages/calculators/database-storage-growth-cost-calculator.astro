  intro="If your database grows steadily, average GB over a month is often a better cost estimate than the end-of-month number. This tool estimates growth and the implied average monthly storage cost."
  examples={[
    "Starting 500 GB and growing 5 GB/day over 6 months → estimate ending size and average monthly cost.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Ending size estimate using a linear growth assumption.",
    "Average size estimate and implied average monthly storage cost.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Non-linear growth, compaction, and retention policies that change growth rate.",
    "Replica/index/storage-class multipliers unless you model them in effective GB.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Ending GB ≈ starting GB + (growth GB/day × days).",
    "Average GB ≈ (starting + ending) ÷ 2 (linear growth assumption).",
    "Estimated monthly cost ≈ average GB × storage price per GB-month."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Is growth really linear?",
      a: "Not always. Use this as a planning approximation, and update with real metrics over time."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I include indexes and replicas?",
      a: "Yes, if your provider bills them separately. You can increase the effective storage GB or model components separately."
