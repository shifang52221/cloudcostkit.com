  intro="If your database grows steadily, average GB over a month is often a better cost estimate than the end-of-month number. This tool estimates growth and the implied average monthly storage cost."

  how={[
    "Ending GB ~ starting GB + (growth GB/day x days).",
    "Average GB ~ (starting + ending) ÷ 2 (linear growth assumption).",
    "Estimated monthly cost ~ average GB x storage price per GB-month."

      q: "Is growth really linear?",
      a: "Not always. Use this as a planning approximation, and update with real metrics over time."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I include indexes and replicas?",
      a: "Yes, if your provider bills them separately. You can increase the effective storage GB or model components separately."

    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Compute</strong>: instance-hours (or average serverless capacity) and a peak scenario.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage</strong>: average GB-month plus growth over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Backups</strong>: retention and churn (daily changed data x retention days) as a separate line item.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignoring backup storage and long-term retention growth.</li>
      <li>Modeling only today’s size and missing 3–12 month growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare forecast vs actual storage/backup GB-month after a few weeks.</li>
      <li>Re-check during batch jobs or backfills (churn spikes).</li>
    </ul>
