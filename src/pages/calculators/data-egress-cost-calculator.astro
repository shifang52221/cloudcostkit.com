  intro="Data egress can be a major driver of cloud spend. Use this calculator to estimate monthly egress cost with your own pricing assumptions."
  examples={[
    "If you send 2,500 GB/month and your effective price is $0.09/GB, estimated cost is $225/month.",
  ]}
  includes={[
    "Bandwidth-only cost estimate from transferred GB and $/GB pricing.",
    "Works for internet egress, service egress, or any scenario where you know an effective $/GB.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Tiered pricing steps and free allowances (unless you reflect them in your effective $/GB).",
    "Per-request fees and other service-specific charges.",
  ]}
  how={[
    "Monthly cost = egress GB × price per GB.",
    "Enter your provider’s effective $/GB for the region/path/tier you expect.",
    "This page ignores free allowances, tiered steps, and rounding unless you model them in the inputs."

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why does egress pricing vary so much?",
      a: "Egress pricing often depends on destination (internet vs cross-region), tiered usage, service (CDN vs origin), and region."
    },
    {
      q: "GB vs GiB: which unit should I use?",
      a: "Cloud billing often uses decimal GB (1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes). Some tooling shows GiB (binary). Use the Units Converter to translate."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include request fees or CDN costs?",
      a: "No. This tool estimates bandwidth-based egress only."
