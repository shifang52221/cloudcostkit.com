  intro="Data egress can be a major driver of cloud spend. Use this calculator to estimate monthly egress cost with your own pricing assumptions."
  examples={[
    "If you send 2,500 GB/month and your effective price is $0.09/GB, estimated cost is $225/month.",

    "Bandwidth-only cost estimate from transferred GB and $/GB pricing.",
    "Works for internet egress, service egress, or any scenario where you know an effective $/GB.",

  excludes={[
    "Tiered pricing steps and free allowances (unless you reflect them in your effective $/GB).",

  how={[
    "Monthly cost = egress GB x price per GB.",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "Why does egress pricing vary so much?",
      a: "Egress pricing often depends on destination (internet vs cross-region), tiered usage, service (CDN vs origin), and region."
    },
    {
      q: "GB vs GiB: which unit should I use?",
      a: "Cloud billing often uses decimal GB (1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes). Some tooling shows GiB (binary). Use the Units Converter to translate."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include request fees or CDN costs?",
      a: "No. This tool estimates bandwidth-based egress only."

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px">Tips</h2>
    <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px">
      <li>Model multiple scenarios: baseline month vs peak month.</li>
      <li>Consider a CDN: it can reduce origin egress and shift cost structure.</li>
      <li>Watch for tiering and minimum charges in provider pricing.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="prose" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GB/month</strong>: start from billing exports/flow logs; if you only have throughput, convert Mbps to GB/month.</li>
      <li><strong>Boundaries</strong>: separate cross-AZ vs cross-region vs internet egress as separate line items.</li>
      <li><strong>Effective rates</strong>: use your blended $/GB for the traffic mix you expect.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mixing boundaries and applying the wrong $/GB rate.</li>
      <li>Ignoring retries/timeouts that multiply traffic during incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Validate the top transfer paths and AZ/region locality after architecture changes.</li>
      <li>Re-check during peak windows (that’s when hidden multipliers show up).</li>
    </ul>
