  intro="Estimate Fargate-style compute cost from average running tasks, vCPU per task, memory per task, and hours per month. Enter your region pricing to get a planning estimate."
  examples={[
    "3 tasks running 730 hours/month at 0.5 vCPU and 1 GB each — estimate vCPU-hours + GB-hours charges.",
    "For autoscaling services, use average running tasks, not peak.",

  includes={[
    "vCPU-hour and memory GB-hour compute charges (modeled with your $/unit inputs).",
    "A simple steady-state model for average running tasks over a month.",
  ]}
  excludes={[
    "Load balancers, data transfer/egress, NAT, and private link costs (model separately).",
    "Logs/metrics ingestion and retention costs (model separately).",
    "Tiering, discounts, and rounding rules unless you reflect them in inputs.",

  how={[
    "vCPU-hours = tasks × vCPU per task × hours per month.",
    "GB-hours = tasks × memory (GB) per task × hours per month.",
    "Total = (vCPU-hours × $/vCPU-hour) + (GB-hours × $/GB-hour).",

  faqs={[
    {
      q: "What should I use for hours per month?",
      a: "A common planning value is ~730 hours/month for 24/7 services. If you schedule down, use fewer hours or use an average running-tasks value.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I model autoscaling?",
      a: "Use average running tasks over the month. If you only know peak tasks, estimate an average (for example, peak × 0.3 to 0.7 depending on traffic shape).",
    },
    {
      q: "Does this include data transfer and logs?",
      a: "No. Fargate compute is only part of the bill. For many services, transfer (egress/NAT) and logging can be significant separate line items.",
