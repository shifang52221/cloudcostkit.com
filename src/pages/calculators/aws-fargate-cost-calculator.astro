    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tasks</strong>: use average running tasks from ECS metrics, not peak or desired count.</li>
      <li><strong>Task size</strong>: pull vCPU and memory from the task definition (GB, not MB).</li>
      <li><strong>Pricing</strong>: use region-specific vCPU-hour and GB-hour rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule</strong>: hours/day and days/month should reflect real uptime windows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If memory cost dominates, right-size memory per task or adjust task count.</li>
      <li>If vCPU cost dominates, check CPU utilization and consider lower vCPU per task.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using peak task count as the average baseline.</li>
      <li>Mixing MB and GB for memory inputs.</li>
      <li>Assuming data transfer or logs are included in compute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Tasks</th>
          <th>vCPU</th>
          <th>Memory</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Average</td>
          <td>Configured</td>
          <td>Configured</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>Configured</td>
          <td>Configured</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare vCPU-hours and GB-hours in billing to your estimate.</li>
      <li>Check ECS service metrics for average running tasks.</li>
    </ul>
