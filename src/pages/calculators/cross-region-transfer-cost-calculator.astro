    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to get your inputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GB/month</strong>: start from billing exports/flow logs; if you only have throughput, convert Mbps to GB/month.</li>
      <li><strong>Boundaries</strong>: separate cross-AZ vs cross-region vs internet egress as separate line items.</li>
      <li><strong>Effective rates</strong>: use your blended $/GB for the traffic mix you expect.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Result interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cross-region traffic is often one-way; confirm the billed direction.</li>
      <li>Replication, DR, and backfill spikes should be modeled separately from steady-state.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mixing boundaries and applying the wrong $/GB rate.</li>
      <li>Ignoring retries/timeouts that multiply traffic during incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Input checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify source and destination region pairs.</li>
      <li>Separate steady replication from one-time backfills or migrations.</li>
      <li>Confirm billing direction (outbound vs inbound).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario planning</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>GB/month</th>
          <th>Direction</th>
          <th>Drivers</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Baseline</td>
          <td>Expected</td>
          <td>Primary -> DR</td>
          <td>Steady replication</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Peak</td>
          <td>High</td>
          <td>Primary -> DR</td>
          <td>Backfill/migration</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Validate after changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Validate the top transfer paths and AZ/region locality after architecture changes.</li>
      <li>Re-check during peak windows (that’s when hidden multipliers show up).</li>
    </ul>
