  <p>
    If you are searching for a <a href="/calculators/storage-pricing-calculator/">storage pricing calculator</a>, you are
    usually trying to estimate S3-like object storage cost. The good news: most object storage bills can be explained by
    three buckets: <strong>storage</strong>, <strong>requests</strong>, and <strong>egress</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Storage is billed over time, often as "GB-month". If your storage grows over the month, use an average stored GB
    number, not the end-of-month peak.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object storage cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Request fees (GET/PUT/LIST)</h2>
  <p>Many workloads treat request fees as noise, and often they are. But request fees can become meaningful when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You store millions of small objects.</li>
    <li>You have heavy LIST operations or frequent metadata reads.</li>
    <li>Your application pattern causes many PUT/GET operations per GB stored.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/s3-request-cost-calculator/">S3 request cost</a> and{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">object storage cost</a> (model requests as a separate line item).
  </p>

  <h2>3) Egress (data transfer out)</h2>
  <p>
    Egress is often the biggest surprise. If you read large amounts of data out of storage (downloads, analytics,
    cross-region access), the $/GB transfer charge can dominate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data egress cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Hidden items to watch for</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Replication and cross-region copy</strong>: adds transfer/feature fees and duplicate storage. Start with{" "}
      <a href="/guides/copy-storage-pricing/">copy storage pricing</a> and{" "}
      <a href="/guides/s3-replication-cost/">S3 replication cost</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Different storage classes</strong>: IA/archive tiers can introduce retrieval and transition fees.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Growth over time</strong>: long retention or backups can turn a small daily ingest into a large monthly
      storage bill. Use <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">DB storage growth</a> as a simple
      estimator if you do not have a better model yet.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recommended modeling approach</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Estimate average stored GB.</li>
    <li>Estimate monthly request volume (GET/PUT/LIST).</li>
    <li>Estimate egress GB/month (if any).</li>
    <li>Add replication/copy costs if you move data.</li>
  </ol>
