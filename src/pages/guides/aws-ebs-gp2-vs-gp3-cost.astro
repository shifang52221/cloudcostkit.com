  <p>
    gp2 vs gp3 decisions are usually about <strong>decoupling storage and performance</strong>. gp3 lets you buy storage
    separately from IOPS/throughput, which can reduce cost when you were overpaying for performance on gp2.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Storage GB-month (baseline)</li>
    <li>Required IOPS and throughput (from metrics)</li>
    <li>Any performance add-ons you need to buy (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to compare (practical workflow)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Measure steady IOPS and throughput requirements.</li>
    <li>Model gp3 storage + performance add-ons using your pricing assumptions.</li>
    <li>Compare to gp2 baseline for the same storage size.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Where gp3 usually wins</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Volumes sized for capacity where gp2 performance was “wasted”.</li>
    <li>Workloads that need predictable performance without increasing storage size.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where gp3 can lose</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When you buy large IOPS/throughput add-ons that exceed what you really use.</li>
    <li>When workload performance is bursty and you don’t model peaks separately.</li>
  </ul>
