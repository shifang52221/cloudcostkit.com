      q: "Is gp3 always cheaper than gp2?",
      a: "Often, but not always. The cost depends on your volume size and how much IOPS/throughput you provision. You should model your workload and validate performance.",

      q: "What is the key difference for cost modeling?",

  <p>
    gp2 and gp3 are general-purpose EBS volume types. Cost comparisons often go wrong when you compare only the $/GB
    number and ignore that performance knobs and baselines can force you to over-provision.
  </p>

  <h2>gp2 vs gp3 breakpoints</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IOPS needs</strong>: sustained IOPS requirement.</li>
    <li><strong>Throughput</strong>: sequential MB/s requirement.</li>
    <li><strong>Size</strong>: gp2 scales IOPS with size; gp3 does not.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>How the cost model differs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>gp2</strong>: performance is more tightly coupled to volume size; you may grow GB just to get IOPS.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>gp3</strong>: you can provision size, IOPS, and throughput more independently (within limits).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When gp3 tends to win</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You have many moderately sized volumes and want predictable performance without over-sizing.</li>
    <li>You want to set explicit IOPS/throughput targets based on measured utilization.</li>
    <li>You want to separate “capacity growth” decisions from “performance” decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When gp2 can still be fine</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your volumes are already sized primarily for capacity and meet performance needs without tuning.</li>
    <li>You have low to moderate IOPS needs and do not need tight performance controls.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Simple decision heuristic</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are increasing volume size mainly to "get more IOPS", gp3 is usually worth modeling.</li>
    <li>If you rarely touch performance settings and your workload is not I/O sensitive, gp2 may be sufficient.</li>
    <li>If you need predictable performance targets per volume, gp3 is generally easier to reason about.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked workflow: compare with measured utilization</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Measure current IOPS and throughput utilization (average and p95) for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Identify which volumes are “oversized for performance” (large GB but low usage).</li>
    <li>Model gp3 with explicit IOPS/throughput targets and compare monthly cost.</li>
    <li>Validate performance in a canary or staging environment before migrating a fleet.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing only $/GB and ignoring IOPS/throughput needs.</li>
    <li>Using peak metrics as a baseline (over-provisioning performance).</li>
    <li>Changing volume type without a validation window and rollback plan.</li>
    <li>Forgetting snapshots: volume changes do not reduce snapshot retention unless policies change too.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Migration checklist (safe switching)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick a representative set of volumes (different workloads and sizes).</li>
    <li>Capture baseline latency, IOPS, throughput, and error rates for a week.</li>
    <li>Switch in canary and validate p95 latency under the same workload.</li>
    <li>Roll out gradually, and keep a rollback path for the workloads that are sensitive.</li>
  </ul>
