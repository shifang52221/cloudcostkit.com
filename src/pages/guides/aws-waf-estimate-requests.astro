  <p>
    WAF request charges scale with <strong>evaluated requests</strong>. A good estimate starts with your real traffic and
    then adds a safety factor for bot spikes and incidents.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: From average RPS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month = avg RPS x 60 x 60 x 24 x days</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Use an average over a representative period (e.g., 30 days).</li>
    <li>Add a buffer if you have frequent bot spikes or peak-driven workloads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: From CDN/LB metrics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the request count metric from your CDN or load balancer and roll it up to a month.</li>
    <li>Segment by host/path if only some traffic is protected by WAF.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 3: From logs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count request records per day from access logs/WAF logs, then average to monthly.</li>
    <li>Include blocked traffic and retries; they are still evaluated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn volume into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-waf-cost-calculator/">AWS WAF Cost Calculator</a> to translate ACLs, rules, and request
    volume into an estimate.
