    Replication is rarely "free". Even when the feature itself is simple, the bill usually combines a few different
    charges: data copied, extra replica storage, and sometimes request fees and transfer.
  </p>

  <h2>What volume should you count?</h2>
  <p>
    For most workloads, replication volume is closer to <strong>changed data</strong> than <strong>total stored data</strong>.
    If your bucket holds 20 TB but only 50 GB/day changes, your replication volume is driven by 50 GB/day (plus retries and
    overhead), not 20 TB.
  </p>

  <h2>Replication cost components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Replication data (GB/month)</strong>: bytes copied from source to destination.</li>
    <li><strong>Replica storage</strong>: you now store (almost) the same objects in a second region.</li>
    <li><strong>Requests</strong>: additional PUT/GET/LIST operations may be billed depending on provider/product.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer</strong>: some setups effectively bill replication as cross-region transfer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fast estimation checklist</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Estimate changed data per day (GB/day), then multiply by ~30.4 to get <strong>GB/month</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Price the replication fee with the <a href="/calculators/storage-replication-cost-calculator/">Storage Replication Cost Calculator</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add replica storage with the <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object Storage Cost Calculator</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If your provider bills this as transfer, price it with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">Cross-Region Transfer Cost</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Counting the full bucket size</strong>: replication is driven by writes/changes. Use changed GB unless you
      are doing a one-time backfill.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ignoring replica storage</strong>: even if replication transfer is cheap, storing a second copy can dominate
      monthly cost.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Request fees</strong>: many small objects can create high request volume. Model requests if they are a large
      part of your workload.
    </li>
  </ul>
