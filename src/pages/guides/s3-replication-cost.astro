  <p>
    Replication is rarely "free". Even when the feature itself is simple, the bill usually combines a few different
    charges: data copied, extra replica storage, and sometimes request fees and transfer.
  </p>

  <h2>What volume should you count?</h2>
  <p>
    For most workloads, replication volume is closer to <strong>changed data</strong> than <strong>total stored data</strong>.
    If your bucket holds 20 TB but only 50 GB/day changes, your replication volume is driven by 50 GB/day (plus retries and
    overhead), not 20 TB.

  </p>

  <h2>Replication cost components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Replication data (GB/month)</strong>: bytes copied from source to destination.</li>
    <li><strong>Replica storage</strong>: you now store (almost) the same objects in a second location.</li>
    <li><strong>Requests</strong>: additional PUT/GET/LIST operations may be billed depending on provider/product.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer</strong>: some setups effectively bill replication as cross-region transfer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fast estimation checklist</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Estimate changed data per day (GB/day), then multiply by ~30.4 to get <strong>GB/month</strong>.</li>
    <li>
      Price the per-GB replication line item with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/s3-replication-cost-calculator/">S3 replication cost calculator</a> or{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/storage-replication-cost-calculator/">storage replication cost calculator</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add replica storage with <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">object storage cost calculator</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If your provider bills this as transfer, price it with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">cross-region transfer cost</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>CRR vs SRR (when choosing an option)</h2>
  <p>
    Cross-region replication (CRR) often adds transfer-like charges compared to same-region replication (SRR). Use this
    comparison checklist: <a href="/guides/s3-crr-vs-srr-cost/">S3 CRR vs SRR cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Counting the full bucket size</strong>: replication is driven by writes/changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring replica storage</strong>: storing a second copy can dominate monthly cost.</li>
    <li><strong>Request fees</strong>: many small objects can create high request volume.</li>
  </ul>

    minimums, and regional pricing). Use this as a planning framework and confirm details in official docs.
