  <p>
    Metrics API request costs (GetMetricData and similar calls) can become meaningful when dashboards and tools poll
    frequently. A good estimate is based on <strong>refresh behavior</strong>, not on guesswork.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: inventory the callers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>CloudWatch dashboards</strong>: human views + wallboards + auto-refresh.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Third-party tools</strong>: Grafana, NOC tooling, custom scripts polling metrics.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automations</strong>: scheduled jobs that pull metrics for reports and capacity planning.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: estimate requests from dashboards (fast model)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Rough model: API requests/day ~= views/day × refreshes/view × widgets/dashboard × queries/widget
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Views/day</strong>: how often dashboards are opened (include wallboards as continuous views).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Refreshes/view</strong>: depends on refresh interval and typical session duration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Widgets</strong>: number of widgets per dashboard.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Queries/widget</strong>: many widgets query multiple metrics (dimensions, percentiles, multiple series).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: include tools polling (often the hidden driver)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>List each tool and its refresh interval (e.g., every 10s, 30s, 60s).</li>
    <li>Estimate metrics queried per refresh (dashboards, panels, and alert evaluations).</li>
    <li>Multiply by number of users or number of running instances (for distributed polling setups).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Add an incident multiplier</h2>
  <p>
    During incidents, engineers open multiple dashboards and run many ad-hoc investigations. For planning, include a
    “busy day” factor (for example, 5–10× normal dashboard views).
  </p>

  <h2>Worked example (order-of-magnitude)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Dashboards: 40 views/day</li>
    <li>Refreshes per view: 6 (10-minute session with ~2-minute refresh)</li>
    <li>Widgets: 24 per dashboard</li>
    <li>Queries per widget: 2 (two series or two dimensions)</li>
    <li>API requests/day ~= 40 * 6 * 24 * 2 ~= 11,520</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    This is just the dashboard component. Add third-party tooling polling and wallboards to complete the picture.
  </p>

  <h2>How to reduce requests (without breaking monitoring)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase refresh interval for slow-moving metrics.</li>
    <li>Reduce widgets and series per widget; aggregate at the service level.</li>
    <li>Consolidate overlapping dashboards and remove unused ones.</li>
    <li>Ensure only one tool polls CloudWatch as the source-of-truth (avoid duplicated polling).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn it into cost</h2>

    <a class="btn" href="/guides/aws-cloudwatch-dashboards-pricing/">Dashboard pricing</a>
  </div>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure a real week of metrics API request counts and compare to the model.</li>
    <li>Identify “always-on” polling (wallboards and NOC screens) and quantify their refresh intervals.</li>
    <li>Confirm whether multiple tools poll the same metrics in parallel.</li>
    <li>After changes, validate dashboards still load and alerting still works.</li>
  </ul>
