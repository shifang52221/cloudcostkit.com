  <p>
    CloudWatch Metrics-style pricing can include an <strong>API requests</strong> line item. It tends to show up when you
    have many dashboards, frequent refresh, and heavy polling from automation/exporters.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Estimate dashboard-driven requests</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Practical model: <strong>widgets queried per refresh x refreshes per month</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Count your dashboards and estimate widgets per dashboard.</li>
    <li>Estimate refresh interval (for example, every 60 seconds vs every 5 minutes).</li>
    <li>Model peak usage (incident war rooms, NOC screens) separately if it is frequent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Add exporters and automation polling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Metric scrapers/exporters (periodic GetMetricData loops)</li>
    <li>Autoscaling and scheduled jobs that query metrics</li>
    <li>Third-party tooling that pulls metrics across many accounts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Budget a high-usage scenario</h2>
  <p>
    If you are unsure, build two estimates: a low-usage baseline and a high-usage scenario (more dashboards, faster
    refresh, more services). This avoids missing the line item in forecasts.
  </p>

  <h2>Turn requests into dollars</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-metrics-cost-calculator/">CloudWatch Metrics Cost Calculator</a> and set the API
    request pricing input to your effective $ per 1k requests.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
