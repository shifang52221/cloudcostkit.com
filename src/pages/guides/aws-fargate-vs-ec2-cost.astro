  <p>
    Fargate vs EC2 cost is mostly a question of <strong>idle capacity</strong> and <strong>packing efficiency</strong>.
    Fargate bills the resources of running tasks; EC2 bills the whole instance whether tasks use it or not. Use this
    checklist to compare with consistent assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 0: normalize assumptions (otherwise you compare apples to oranges)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Average demand</strong>: typical vCPU and memory actually used (not peak-only).</li>
    <li><strong>Burstiness</strong>: how often you hit peak and how quickly you scale up/down.</li>
    <li><strong>Scheduling</strong>: always-on vs business-hours vs batch windows.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-compute</strong>: load balancers, logs, and data transfer baseline.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you only know traffic, start with <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS → monthly requests</a> and validate later with metrics.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: model Fargate as task resources × hours</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>vCPU-hours</strong> = avg running tasks × vCPU per task × hours/month</li>
    <li><strong>GB-hours</strong> = avg running tasks × memory (GB) per task × hours/month</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">

  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: model EC2 as instances × hours (then adjust for utilization)</h2>
  <p>
    EC2 cost depends on how well you pack tasks. If you run large instances at 20% utilization, EC2 “loses” even if the
    per-vCPU rate is cheaper.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Instance-hours</strong> = instance count × hours/month</li>
    <li><strong>Effective utilization</strong>: subtract overhead and fragmentation; don’t assume 100% packing.</li>
    <li><strong>Attached storage</strong>: EBS volumes and snapshots are separate line items.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What usually decides the winner</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Idle</strong>: if your average demand is far below peak, Fargate often wins by not paying for idle instances.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Packing</strong>: if you can keep instances hot (high utilization), EC2 often wins.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ops overhead</strong>: EC2 requires capacity management (AMIs, scaling groups, patching); if that causes overprovisioning, cost rises.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Don’t ignore the non-compute bills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Load balancers</strong>: always-on hourly baseline plus capacity units.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion GB/day + retention (often bigger than expected).</li>
    <li><strong>Networking</strong>: NAT processed GB and cross-AZ transfer from chatty services.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing peak capacity instead of average (budgets follow average).</li>
    <li>Assuming perfect EC2 packing and ignoring fragmentation and headroom.</li>
    <li>Ignoring EBS and snapshot costs for EC2-backed clusters.</li>
    <li>Optimizing compute and then discovering logs/transfer are the top drivers.</li>
    <li>Leaving non-prod always-on and attributing the waste to “service pricing”.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate after you choose</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure average running tasks vs planned (Fargate) or average instance utilization (EC2).</li>
    <li>In billing, confirm compute is not being dwarfed by LB/log/transfer lines.</li>
    <li>After deploys/incidents, check whether you scale down quickly (or pay for long tail idle).</li>
  </ul>
