  <p>
    “Fargate vs EC2 cost” is usually a question about <strong>idle capacity</strong> and <strong>operational overhead</strong>.
    Compute list prices are rarely the whole story. Use the checklist below to compare apples-to-apples.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: normalize workload shape</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Average capacity</strong>: average running tasks/instances over the month (not peak).</li>
    <li><strong>Traffic shape</strong>: steady, bursty, or scheduled down.</li>
    <li><strong>Constraints</strong>: latency, cold starts, and scaling behavior.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: compare compute-only cost</h2>
  <p>
    Start with compute-only to get a baseline, then iterate.

  </div>

  <h2>Step 3: add line items that often dominate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers</strong>: multiple services behind ALBs/NLBs can drive a large baseline.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion + retention (and scan/search) can exceed compute for noisy services.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Networking</strong>: NAT gateway processed traffic, internet egress, and cross-AZ transfer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong>: EBS volumes, snapshots, and I/O can matter for stateful workloads.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Practical guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick Fargate when you want speed, fewer ops concerns, and smaller or uncertain steady-state usage.</li>
    <li>Pick EC2 when you can keep utilization high, apply commitments, and manage platform overhead efficiently.</li>
    <li>Revisit after measuring average utilization and traffic; don’t decide from list prices alone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
