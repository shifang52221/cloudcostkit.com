  <p>
    GKE planning gets accurate when you treat it as a stack: compute (nodes), networking, storage, and observability. This
    checklist gives you a safe baseline for budgeting and an audit path for an existing bill.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Node pools (instance-hours)</h2>
  <p>Model each pool: instance type, min/max nodes, and average hours per month.</p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/compute-instance-cost-calculator/">Compute instance cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Packing (requests/limits)</h2>
  <p>
    Requests drive how many pods fit on a node. Over-requesting is a common cost leak. Validate overhead (kube-system,
    DaemonSets) and reserved capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-requests-limits-calculator/">Requests/limits helper</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Egress and load balancing</h2>
  <p>
    Internet-facing services often have material egress. Split egress by destination and validate whether traffic is served
    via CDN (which changes origin egress).
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Storage</h2>
  <p>Persistent volumes are a GB-month driver. Include snapshots/backups and validate retention windows.</p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/storage-pricing-calculator/">Storage pricing (generic)</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Logs and metrics</h2>
  <p>
    Logging and metrics scale with pod count and verbosity. If each request emits multiple log lines, log ingestion can
    exceed compute. Estimate ingestion and retention explicitly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">Log cost tools</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate node utilization vs requested resources (look for over-requesting and bin-packing gaps).</li>
    <li>Validate outbound GB by destination and peak periods (deployments, incidents, scale-outs).</li>
    <li>Validate log volume per request and retention policies.</li>
  </ul>
