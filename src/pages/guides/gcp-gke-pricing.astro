<GuideLayout title={title} description={description} canonicalPath="/guides/gcp-gke-pricing" lastUpdated="2026-01-27" faqs={faqs}>
  <p>
    GKE planning gets accurate when you treat it as a stack: compute (nodes), networking (LB/egress/inter-zone), storage, and
    observability. The goal is not just to estimate, but to keep the cluster right-sized as traffic and workloads change.
  </p>

  <h2>0) What to model (drivers you can validate)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Node pools</strong>: instance type, min/max nodes, and average node-hours per month.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bin packing</strong>: requests/limits, kube-system overhead, and DaemonSets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Networking</strong>: load balancers, internet egress, inter-zone traffic, and private connectivity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong>: PV GB-month, snapshots, and retention windows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs/metrics</strong>: ingestion volume, retention, and scan/search behavior during incidents.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Node pools: instance-hours (baseline and peak)</h2>
  <p>
    Model each pool separately and keep baseline vs peak months distinct. Scale-out events often do not average out in
    practice (marketing, seasonality, incident retries).

  </p>

  <h2>2) Requests/limits: the bin packing multiplier</h2>
  <p>
    Requests determine how many pods fit on a node. Over-requesting is one of the most common cost leaks. Validate overhead
    (kube-system, DaemonSets) and reserve capacity explicitly.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-requests-limits-calculator/">Requests/limits helper</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For CPU-bound workloads, right-sized CPU requests can reduce nodes dramatically.</li>
    <li>For memory-bound workloads, use p95 memory to avoid OOM churn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Networking: load balancers, egress, and inter-zone traffic</h2>
  <p>
    Internet-facing services often have meaningful egress. Multi-zone clusters also generate inter-zone east-west traffic
    that does not show up as "internet bandwidth" but still affects the bill.

    <a href="/guides/gcp-inter-zone-transfer-costs/">Inter-zone transfer</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Storage: PVs, snapshots, retention</h2>
  <p>
    Persistent volumes are a GB-month driver. Snapshots/backups and retention windows add a quiet multiplier, especially for
    stateful workloads.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/storage-pricing-calculator/">Storage pricing (generic)</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Observability: logs and metrics</h2>
  <p>
    Logging and metrics scale with pod count and verbosity. If each request emits multiple log lines, log ingestion can
    exceed compute. Model ingestion and retention explicitly.
  </p>

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">Log cost tools</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Nodes</strong> = sum(node pool avg node-hours/month) (baseline + peak)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bin packing</strong> = effective pods/node based on requests/limits (headroom + overhead)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress</strong> = outbound GB/month (internet + cross-region) + inter-zone GB/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong> = PV GB-month + snapshot GB-month (retention)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong> = log GB/month + retention/scan assumptions
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Over-requesting CPU/memory so pods cannot pack (node count inflates).</li>
    <li>Not splitting system overhead (DaemonSets and kube-system are real capacity).</li>
    <li>Ignoring egress and load balancers (often the second-largest driver after nodes).</li>
    <li>Verbose logs per request and long retention windows.</li>
    <li>Underestimating inter-zone east-west traffic in multi-zone clusters.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate node utilization vs requested resources (find over-requesting and bin packing gaps).</li>
    <li>Validate outbound GB by destination and peak periods (deployments, incidents, scale-outs).</li>
    <li>Validate log bytes per request and retention policies.</li>
  </ul>
