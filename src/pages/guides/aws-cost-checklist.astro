  <p>
    If your AWS bill feels “mysterious”, it usually means you are missing a driver. Most costs scale with a small set of
    units: <strong>hours</strong>, <strong>requests</strong>, <strong>GB transferred</strong>, and <strong>GB-month stored</strong>.
    This checklist helps you capture the drivers that actually move spend.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Define scope (avoid mixing worlds)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Accounts and regions included</li>
    <li>Environments (prod vs staging vs dev)</li>
    <li>Time window and seasonality (baseline vs busy month)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Identify the top 5 line items first</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use billing/Cost Explorer to find the top services by spend.</li>
    <li>For each service, write down the primary driver unit (hours, requests, GB, GB-month).</li>
    <li>Do not optimize everything at once; fix the top drivers first.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Data transfer: the most common hidden bill</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Internet egress (bytes leaving AWS)</li>
    <li>Cross-AZ traffic (often accidental)</li>
    <li>Cross-region traffic and replication</li>
    <li>NAT gateways and load balancers can change where transfer shows up</li>
  </ul>

    <a class="btn" href="/guides/aws-cross-az-data-transfer-cost/">Cross-AZ cost guide</a>
  </div>

  <h2>4) Logs and metrics: ingestion + retention + scans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Log ingestion (GB/day) and retention (GB-month)</li>
    <li>Query scan costs (Insights/Athena/SIEM)</li>
    <li>Custom metric cardinality and dashboard polling</li>
  </ul>

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/cloudwatch-metrics-cost-calculator/">CloudWatch metrics cost</a>
  </div>

  <h2>5) Request-based services: count requests before pricing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>CDN requests and bandwidth (origin vs edge)</li>
    <li>API requests and response size (requests + transfer)</li>
    <li>Database requests (read/write units, query scans)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you only know RPS, convert it to monthly requests and then model cost drivers.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Storage: GB-month + requests + snapshots</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Object storage: GB-month and request volume</li>
    <li>Block storage: volume GB-month, provisioned IOPS/throughput, snapshots</li>
    <li>Replication: storage copies and transfer</li>
  </ul>

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/aws-ebs-cost-calculator/">EBS cost</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/aws-ebs-snapshot-cost-calculator/">EBS snapshots</a>
  </div>

  <h2>7) Reliability incidents are also cost incidents</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Retry storms multiply requests, logs, and transfer.</li>
    <li>Incidents increase query scans (people search logs repeatedly).</li>
    <li>Capacity spikes (autoscaling) increase hours and cross-AZ patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Validation checklist (so the model is trusted)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate each primary driver from measured telemetry (logs/metrics/billing) for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Use two scenarios: baseline and busy month.</li>
    <li>Confirm unit consistency (GB vs GiB, requests units, per-hour vs per-second).</li>
    <li>After changes, compare against the next week of real billing and adjust assumptions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Make the model operational</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Write down assumptions and owners (who updates request volume, who updates storage growth).</li>
    <li>Link each driver to the place you measure it (metrics, logs, billing report).</li>
    <li>Update monthly: keep a small set of calculators and checklists close to the team.</li>
  </ul>
