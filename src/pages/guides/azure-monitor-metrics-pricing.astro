  <p>
    Metrics systems are “time series × frequency × retention”. Costs spike when you accidentally create a huge number of
    distinct series (high cardinality) or when dashboards/alerts query wide time windows frequently.
  </p>

  <h2>1) How many time series?</h2>
  <p>
    Time series count is the biggest design lever. A metric with labels like <strong>pod</strong>, <strong>container</strong>,
    <strong>path</strong>, or <strong>customerId</strong> can explode cardinality. Model the number of unique combinations.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Sample rate</h2>
  <p>
    Sample rate (e.g., 10s vs 60s) multiplies ingestion volume. For planning, model both a “normal” and a “high-frequency”
    scenario.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Retention is a storage multiplier. Long retention can be expensive if you store high-resolution data for months.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Dashboards, alerts, and API calls</h2>
  <p>
    Repeated queries (dashboards refreshing every minute, alert rules scanning 24h windows) can create significant query/API
    load. Model refresh frequency explicitly.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate cardinality drivers (labels/dimensions) and cap unbounded labels.</li>
    <li>Validate sample rates (emit/scrape intervals) and ensure they match your needs.</li>
    <li>Validate dashboard refresh intervals and alert windows (avoid repeated wide scans).</li>
  </ul>
