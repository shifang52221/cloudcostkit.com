  <p>
    API Gateway pricing is usually dominated by <strong>request charges</strong> plus <strong>data transfer</strong>.
    Depending on API type and features, you may also see add-ons that matter for production workloads.
  </p>

  <h2>What to include in an estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong> and your effective <strong>$ per million requests</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Average response size</strong> and the effective <strong>egress $/GB</strong> for your traffic path
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logging/metrics</strong> (if enabled) and downstream costs (Lambda, databases, queues)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add-ons</strong> you use (custom domains, WAF, caching, etc.)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast model</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-api-gateway-cost-calculator/">AWS API Gateway Cost Calculator</a> for a quick request +
    transfer estimate. Then add any feature-specific line items you rely on.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Underestimating transfer by using uncompressed payload sizes.</li>
    <li>Retry storms (client retries, SDK retries, timeouts) inflating requests.</li>
    <li>Large responses (lists, exports, file downloads) dominating total spend.</li>
  </ul>
