  <p>
    API Gateway pricing is usually dominated by <strong>request charges</strong> plus <strong>data transfer</strong>.
    Depending on API type and features, you may also see add-ons that matter for production workloads.
  </p>

  <h2>API Gateway pricing inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Requests/month</strong>: from metrics, logs, or RPS conversion.</li>
    <li><strong>Response size</strong>: average KB to estimate transfer costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Effective rates</strong>: blend tiers and region pricing.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Where to get the inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong>: API logs, gateway metrics, or analytics. Use a representative week and model peak
      separately if traffic is bursty.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Payload sizes</strong>: average response size from logs or tracing. Use compressed sizes if compression is
      enabled.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer boundary</strong>: which path is billed (internet egress vs internal vs cross-region).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you only have RPS and average payload size, convert it to GB/month with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">response size transfer</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>What to include in an estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong> and your effective <strong>$ per million requests</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Average response size</strong> and the effective <strong>egress $/GB</strong> for your traffic path
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logging/metrics</strong> (if enabled) and downstream costs (Lambda, databases, queues)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add-ons</strong> you use (custom domains, WAF, caching, etc.)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast model</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-api-gateway-cost-calculator/">AWS API Gateway Cost Calculator</a> for a quick request +
    transfer estimate. Then add any feature-specific line items you rely on.
  </p>

  <h2>When transfer dominates</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Large list endpoints, exports, file downloads, and “fat JSON” responses can dominate spend.</li>
    <li>Retry storms multiply both requests and transfer, even when success traffic is unchanged.</li>
    <li>CDN caching in front of the gateway can reduce origin requests and origin transfer for cacheable traffic.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Underestimating transfer by using uncompressed payload sizes.</li>
    <li>Retry storms (client retries, SDK retries, timeouts) inflating requests.</li>
    <li>Large responses (lists, exports, file downloads) dominating total spend.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units (GB vs GiB) and request pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M).</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
