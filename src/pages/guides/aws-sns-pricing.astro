  <p>
    SNS cost models are easiest when you treat them as <strong>publishes</strong> plus <strong>deliveries</strong>. The
    key idea: deliveries can be much larger than publishes because of fan-out, and retries can multiply delivery
    attempts during failures. This page is a checklist for a realistic estimate.
  </p>

  <h2>What to include in the model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Publishes/month</strong>: how many messages you publish</li>
    <li><strong>Deliveries/month</strong>: how many messages are delivered to endpoints</li>
    <li><strong>Fan-out</strong>: average matched subscribers per publish (after filter policies)</li>
    <li><strong>Protocol mix</strong>: different subscription protocols can have different effective rates</li>
    <li><strong>Retry multiplier</strong>: delivery failures cause repeated attempts</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: estimate publishes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Split by topic: a few topics often dominate publishes.</li>
    <li>Separate prod vs non-prod (test topics can be noisy).</li>
    <li>Keep an “incident day” scenario if alerts are a big use case.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: estimate deliveries (fan-out is the multiplier)</h2>
  <p>
    A fast first-pass formula:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Deliveries/month ≈ publishes/month × matched subscribers per publish</strong></li>
    <li>Use matched subscribers, not “subscribers total” (filter policies reduce effective fan-out).</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: add the retry/alert-storm scenarios</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retry scenario</strong>: failing endpoints multiply delivery attempts.</li>
    <li><strong>Alert storm scenario</strong>: incident triggers high-frequency publishes to high-fan-out topics.</li>
    <li><strong>Downstream coupling</strong>: if SNS fans out to SQS/HTTP endpoints, failures can cascade and amplify retries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Modeling publishes and forgetting deliveries (fan-out is where cost grows).</li>
    <li>Using “subscribers per topic” instead of “matched subscribers per publish”.</li>
    <li>Ignoring retries and treating failures as “rare” (incidents can dominate monthly variance).</li>
    <li>Broadcasting large payloads to many subscribers instead of sending pointers (object links).</li>
    <li>Not separating non-prod traffic (test loops can create high publish/delivery volume).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate after you deploy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare publishes and deliveries from a representative week to your baseline model.</li>
    <li>Check delivery failure rate; if failures are non-trivial, expect higher effective deliveries.</li>
    <li>Validate fan-out after filters: are you delivering broadly when you intended narrow topics?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Publishes/month</strong> = Σ publishes by topic</li>
    <li><strong>Matched fan-out</strong> = subscriptions × filter match rate</li>
    <li><strong>Baseline deliveries</strong> = publishes × matched fan-out</li>
    <li><strong>Peak deliveries</strong> = baseline deliveries × (1 + retry factor) during incident/busy hours</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly cost</strong> = publishes priced + deliveries priced (use blended per-1M rates)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you don’t know match rate or retry factor, model scenarios (e.g., 20%/50%/80% match; 0%/5%/20% retries) and validate later.
