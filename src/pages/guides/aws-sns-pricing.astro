  <p>
    SNS-style costs are easiest to model as <strong>publishes</strong> plus <strong>deliveries</strong>. The key is that
    deliveries can be much larger than publishes when topics have many subscribers.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Publishes/month</strong>: how many messages you publish to topics
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deliveries/month</strong>: messages delivered to subscription endpoints
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fan-out</strong>: average subscribers per message (after filter policies)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Protocol mix</strong>: use an effective blended $ per 1M deliveries
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-sns-cost-calculator/">AWS SNS Cost Calculator</a> to estimate publish + delivery charges
    (plus optional transfer). Then refine deliveries with measurements and fan-out assumptions.
