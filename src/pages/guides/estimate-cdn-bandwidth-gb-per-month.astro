    Most CDN pricing is expressed as <strong>$ per GB</strong>. That means your first job is to estimate{" "}
    <strong>GB per month</strong>. This guide walks through the three most common ways to do that.
  </p>

  <h2>Option 1: Use your CDN analytics directly</h2>
  <p>
    If you already have a CDN in front of traffic, your provider usually reports bytes transferred per time window. Use
    that number and convert it to monthly GB.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for a metric like “bytes served”, “data transferred”, or “egress”.</li>
    <li>Prefer a 30-day window if available; otherwise multiply a typical day by ~30.4.</li>
    <li>
      Keep an eye on units (GB vs GiB). If you see GiB, convert with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Option 2: Convert from Mbps (throughput charts)</h2>
  <p>
    If you only have throughput (Mbps) from monitoring or dashboards, you can convert it into GB/month. The key is to
    use an average throughput value over time, not the peak.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a> to convert Mbps to GB/month, or use this rule of
    thumb:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>1 Mbps sustained ≈ 324 GB/month</strong> (approximate; depends on units and month length)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Example: if your average throughput is 50 Mbps, that’s roughly 50 × 324 ≈ 16,200 GB/month (about 16.2 TB/month).
  </p>

  <h2>Option 3: Estimate from page views and payload size</h2>
  <p>
    For early-stage projects without traffic history, approximate bandwidth using content size and expected views:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>GB/month ≈ views/month × average payload MB ÷ 1024</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is rough, but it helps create an initial budget. Once traffic starts, replace the estimate with analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>What to include (and what to ignore)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Include: HTML, JS/CSS, images, downloads, video segments, API responses served from CDN.</li>
    <li>Exclude: internal traffic and synthetic monitoring if it’s not representative (or model separately).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next: turn GB/month into dollars</h2>
  <p>
    After you have GB/month, price it with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN Bandwidth Cost Calculator</a>, then add request fees with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN Request Cost Calculator</a>. If you want a single page that
    bundles both, use <a href="/calculators/cdn-cost-calculator/">CDN Cost Calculator</a>.
