  <p>
    CDN pricing is often expressed as <strong>$ per GB</strong>. That means your first job is to estimate{" "}
    <strong>GB per month</strong> delivered from edge to users. This guide gives three practical methods and a validation
    checklist so your estimate is usable for budgeting.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Decide what you are measuring (edge bandwidth)</h2>
  <p>
    For CDN bandwidth, the relevant number is bytes delivered from the CDN edge to end users. Do not confuse this with
    origin egress (cache fill), which is a different leg.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Related: <a href="/guides/origin-egress-vs-cdn-bandwidth/">origin egress vs CDN bandwidth</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: Use CDN analytics (best)</h2>
  <p>
    If you already run a CDN, your provider usually reports bytes delivered per time window. Use a 30-day window if
    available; otherwise multiply a representative day by ~30.4.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for metrics like "bytes served", "data transferred", or "edge egress".</li>
    <li>Prefer a representative window that includes normal days and a peak day.</li>
    <li>
      If the UI shows GiB or TiB, convert carefully with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Unit converter</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: From RPS and response size (early-stage planning)</h2>
  <p>
    If you know request volume and typical response size, you can estimate bandwidth. This works well for API-like traffic,
    but you must separate heavy-tail endpoints (downloads, large images) instead of blending everything.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">Response transfer</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>GB/month</strong> ~= requests/month × avg response size (GB)
    </li>
    <li>
      Split into at least two buckets: <strong>API-like</strong> (small payloads, high RPS) and <strong>download-like</strong>
      (large payloads, lower RPS).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 3: Convert from throughput (Mbps)</h2>
  <p>
    If you only have throughput charts (monitoring dashboards, load balancer metrics), convert average Mbps into GB/month.
    Use an average value over time, not peak throughput.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Unit converter</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Rule of thumb: <strong>1 Mbps sustained ~= 324 GB/month</strong> (decimal GB).
    </li>
    <li>
      Example: 50 Mbps average ~= 50 × 324 ~= 16,200 GB/month (~16.2 TB/month).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to include (and what to model separately)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Include: HTML, JS/CSS, images, downloads, video segments, API responses served from CDN.
    </li>
    <li>
      Model separately: synthetic monitoring, internal traffic, and large one-off migrations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remember: compression reduces bytes, but not request counts.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Bits vs bytes</strong>: Mbps (bits) vs MB/s (bytes) is an 8× difference.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GB vs GiB</strong>: decimal vs binary units; convert consistently.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Heavy-tail endpoints</strong>: one download route can dominate bytes while most endpoints are tiny.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak windows</strong>: model baseline + peak; do not average peaks away.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next: turn GB/month into dollars</h2>
  <p>
    After you have GB/month, estimate cost with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN bandwidth cost calculator</a>, then add request fees with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN request cost calculator</a>. If you want a single page that
    bundles both, use <a href="/calculators/cdn-cost-calculator/">CDN cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate with a real 7–30 day analytics window once the CDN is live.</li>
    <li>Validate top endpoints by bytes (not just by requests).</li>
    <li>Validate unit conversions (Mbps vs MB/s, GB vs GiB) before trusting the number.</li>
    <li>Validate that the estimate matches directionality when traffic changes (deploys, incidents, marketing spikes).</li>
  </ul>
