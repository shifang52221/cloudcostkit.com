  <p>
    When people search for <a href="/guides/s3-replication-cost/">S3 replication cost</a>, the hardest input is usually not
    the price. It's the volume: <strong>how many GB per month actually replicate?</strong> The key idea is simple:
    replication is driven by <strong>writes and changes</strong>, not by your total stored dataset size.
  </p>

  <h2>Start with the right question</h2>
  <p>Instead of asking "how big is my bucket?", ask:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How many GB/day are newly written or changed?</li>
    <li>How often do objects get overwritten (churn)?</li>
    <li>Do you replicate everything or only a prefix/tags subset?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 1: From GB/day of writes</h2>
  <p>If you can estimate or measure writes in GB/day, monthly replication volume is straightforward:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Replicated GB/month ≈ write GB/day x 30.4 x replication coverage</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Replication coverage is the fraction of writes that are replicated (for example, 0.6 if only 60% of objects match
    the replication rules).
  </p>

  <h2>Method 2: From requests and average object size</h2>
  <p>If you do not have GB/day but you know how many objects are written, approximate GB/day from request volume:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Write GB/day ≈ PUTs/day x avg object size (MB) / 1024</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This works well when your object sizes are reasonably consistent. If sizes vary a lot, break the workload into a few
    buckets (small/medium/large) and sum.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 3: From change rate on an existing dataset</h2>
  <p>
    Some datasets are mostly static but have a measurable churn rate (percentage of data replaced per day or per week).
    If your total dataset is S GB and churn is c% per month:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Replicated GB/month ≈ S x (c / 100)</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Example: 100,000 GB stored with 5% churn per month implies about 5,000 GB/month replicated (plus any new data).
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Using total stored GB</strong> instead of changed GB: replication volume is usually far smaller.</li>
    <li><strong>Forgetting destination storage</strong>: replication often doubles storage for replicated objects.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring extra requests</strong>: replication workflows can increase PUT/GET/LIST operations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn replicated GB/month into dollars</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have replicated GB/month, estimate the replication line item with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/storage-replication-cost-calculator/">Storage replication cost calculator</a>. If replication is
    billed as cross-region transfer in your setup, price it with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">cross-region transfer</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the full picture (extra storage + requests + transfer), use the checklist in{" "}
    <a href="/guides/copy-storage-pricing/">copy storage pricing</a> and add storage pricing with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/storage-pricing-calculator/">storage pricing calculator</a>.
