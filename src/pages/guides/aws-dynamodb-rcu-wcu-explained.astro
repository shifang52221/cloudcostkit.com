  <p class="muted">
    Even if you use on-demand pricing, it helps to understand RCU/WCU because the underlying driver is still “how much
    work” the database does. The two most common estimate breakers are item size and hot partitions.
  </p>

  <h2>1) The two drivers: read work and write work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reads</strong>: scale with request rate and item size.</li>
    <li><strong>Writes</strong>: scale with write rate and item size.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) The practical approach for budgeting</h2>
  <p>
    If you don’t want to model RCUs/WCUs directly, estimate monthly read/write request volume and use an effective “$ per
    1M read requests” and “$ per 1M write requests” that matches your region and plan.

    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-dynamodb-cost-calculator/">AWS DynamoDB Cost Calculator</a> for scenario planning.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Common pitfalls that inflate cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Large items</strong>: bigger payloads increase both request cost and storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Hot partitions</strong>: uneven access causes throttling/retries, which can multiply requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Retries and timeouts</strong>: failures can turn 1 request into many billable attempts.</li>
  </ul>
