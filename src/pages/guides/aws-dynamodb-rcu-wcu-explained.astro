  <p>
    DynamoDB pricing is often described as “RCU/WCU”, but the part that trips teams up is that units are not “one request
    equals one unit”. The effective units depend on <strong>item size</strong>, <strong>access pattern</strong>, and
    whether you scan or query targeted keys.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: define what you need to size</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Reads</strong>: requests/second and average item size returned (plus worst-case ranges).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Writes</strong>: writes/second and average item size written.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Extras</strong>: GSIs and transactional operations can change effective units.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 2: the “item size multiplier” intuition</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If you double the item size, you often increase the consumed capacity per operation. This is why data shape changes
    can change the bill without any traffic change.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Small items: per-request units are closer to the minimum.</li>
    <li>Large items: per-request units increase; scans become especially expensive.</li>
    <li>Indexes: writing one item can mean writing multiple index entries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: sizing examples (planning)</h2>
  <p>
    Treat these as workflow examples, not exact pricing rules. Always validate with official pricing and measured
    consumption for your table.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Example A (reads)</strong>: 200 read requests/second, small items, mostly key queries -> reads dominate by request volume.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Example B (writes)</strong>: 50 write requests/second, large items, multiple indexes -> writes dominate due to amplification.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Example C (scan trap)</strong>: “find recent failures” implemented as a scan -> reads dominate because you read many items to return a few.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate in practice</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Measure request volume (baseline + busy month).</li>
    <li>Measure item sizes (average and p95) for read and write paths.</li>
    <li>List GSIs and determine which write paths update them.</li>
    <li>Identify scans and replace with key-based queries where possible.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Assuming one request equals one unit (item size changes it).</li>
    <li>Forgetting that GSIs add write amplification and storage copies.</li>
    <li>Ignoring retries/timeouts that multiply requests during incidents.</li>
    <li>Using scans for user-facing traffic or dashboards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate item size distribution (average and p95) from real items.</li>
    <li>Validate what percent of reads are scans vs queries.</li>
    <li>Validate GSI count and projections; quantify amplification.</li>
    <li>After changes, compare a real week of usage and adjust your model.</li>
  </ul>
