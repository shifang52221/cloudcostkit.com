    Even if you use on-demand pricing, it helps to understand RCU/WCU because the underlying driver is still how much
    work the database does. The two most common estimate breakers are item size and hot partitions.
  </p>

  <h2>1) The two drivers: read work and write work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reads</strong>: scale with request rate, item size, and consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Writes</strong>: scale with write rate and item size.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Practical budgeting approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimate monthly read and write request volume.</li>
    <li>Estimate average item size (and consider a typical vs peak scenario).</li>
    <li>Use a blended effective rate that matches your region and plan.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>3) Common pitfalls that inflate cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Large items</strong>: bigger payloads increase both request cost and storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Hot partitions</strong>: uneven access causes throttling and retries (more billable attempts).</li>
    <li><strong>Retries and timeouts</strong>: failures can turn 1 request into many billable attempts.</li>
    <li><strong>Chatty access patterns</strong>: many small requests rather than batched reads/writes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure request rates and item sizes for at least 7 days.</li>
    <li>Check for hot keys/partitions and retry loops.</li>
    <li>After changes, confirm throttling and retry volume drop.</li>
  </ul>
