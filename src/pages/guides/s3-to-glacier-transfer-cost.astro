    Moving data from S3 to Glacier is usually cheap, but the workflow can create extra costs. Use this checklist to
    model transition requests, minimum duration rules, and any transfer overhead.
  </p>

  <h2>What to include in the transfer cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transition requests</strong>: lifecycle transitions and batch operations often have per-request fees.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum storage duration</strong>: early deletion can create fees that erase savings.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-region moves</strong>: transfers across regions can incur data transfer charges.</li>
    <li><strong>Rewrites or re-uploads</strong>: data repackaging can double-write costs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Estimate the transition request volume</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count objects to transition (requests track object count).</li>
    <li>Batch operations still count as per-object requests for cost.</li>
    <li>If you have many small objects, request fees can be meaningful.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Check minimum duration rules before migrating</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Archive tiers have minimum storage duration requirements.</li>
    <li>Short-lived objects can trigger early deletion charges.</li>
    <li>If your data changes frequently, reconsider moving it to archive tiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Plan a migration window</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Stagger transitions to avoid large spikes in retrieval or lifecycle activity.</li>
    <li>Track restore needs before moving data to a slower tier.</li>
    <li>Validate a small sample before full migration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Simple cost model (use before migration)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transition requests</strong> = objects transitioned x $ per 1,000 requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage delta</strong> = (current GB-month - archive GB-month) x months retained.</li>
    <li><strong>Early deletion risk</strong> = objects deleted before minimum duration x remaining months.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    The goal is to ensure the storage savings exceed the transition and early deletion penalties.
  </p>

  <h2>Example: lifecycle migration for log archives</h2>
  <p>
    If you move 50 TB of logs into Glacier and keep them for 12 months, the storage savings are large. But if 20% of
    those objects are re-written or deleted within the minimum duration window, early deletion fees can offset a big
    chunk of the expected savings. Validate object churn first.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure object count and average object size (requests scale with count).</li>
    <li>Confirm lifecycle rules do not transition hot or frequently rewritten data.</li>
    <li>Estimate restore frequency (audit or reprocessing jobs) before moving data.</li>
    <li>Run a small pilot and compare the first bill to your model.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Migration strategy tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Transition by age (for example, only objects older than 90 or 180 days).</li>
    <li>Keep a short hot window to avoid immediate restore needs.</li>
    <li>Separate compliance archives from operational logs to reduce restore churn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to monitor after the move</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Early deletion fees and unexpected transitions.</li>
    <li>Restore request volume and average restore size.</li>
    <li>Origin egress during restores (if restored data is copied elsewhere).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data classification checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify data with legal retention or audit requirements.</li>
    <li>Separate frequently accessed reports from cold archives.</li>
    <li>Tag objects with lifecycle intent so rules are predictable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Restore readiness test</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick a sample archive and perform a full restore workflow.</li>
    <li>Measure total time from restore request to usable data.</li>
    <li>Document the steps so future restores are repeatable.</li>
  </ul>
