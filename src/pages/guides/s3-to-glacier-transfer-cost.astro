    Moving data from S3 to Glacier is usually cheap, but the workflow can create extra costs. Use this checklist to
    model transition requests, minimum duration rules, and any transfer overhead.
  </p>

  <h2>What to include in the transfer cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transition requests</strong>: lifecycle transitions and batch operations often have per-request fees.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum storage duration</strong>: early deletion can create fees that erase savings.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-region moves</strong>: transfers across regions can incur data transfer charges.</li>
    <li><strong>Rewrites or re-uploads</strong>: data repackaging can double-write costs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Estimate the transition request volume</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count objects to transition (requests track object count).</li>
    <li>Batch operations still count as per-object requests for cost.</li>
    <li>If you have many small objects, request fees can be meaningful.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Check minimum duration rules before migrating</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Archive tiers have minimum storage duration requirements.</li>
    <li>Short-lived objects can trigger early deletion charges.</li>
    <li>If your data changes frequently, reconsider moving it to archive tiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Plan a migration window</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Stagger transitions to avoid large spikes in retrieval or lifecycle activity.</li>
    <li>Track restore needs before moving data to a slower tier.</li>
    <li>Validate a small sample before full migration.</li>
  </ul>
