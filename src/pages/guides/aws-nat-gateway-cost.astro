  <p>
    NAT gateway bills are often surprising because they combine a fixed hourly baseline with traffic-based processing
    charges. If you put high-throughput or “chatty outbound” workloads behind NAT, costs can scale faster than compute.
    This page shows a simple model and a workflow to estimate and validate the drivers.

  <h2>NAT cost inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hours</strong>: one NAT per AZ is typical.</li>
    <li><strong>Processed GB</strong>: API calls and downloads drive this.</li>
    <li><strong>Endpoints</strong>: VPC endpoints can reduce NAT GB.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>The cost model (what to budget)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gateway-hours</strong>: gateways × hours/month (730 for always-on)</li>
    <li><strong>GB processed</strong>: total GB traversing NAT per month</li>
    <li><strong>Total</strong>: gateway-hours × $/hour + GB processed × $/GB (plus any related transfer/egress lines)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why NAT costs spike (the common root causes)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Container image pulls</strong>: large images pulled by many nodes/tasks, especially during scaling events.</li>
    <li><strong>OS/package updates</strong>: fleets doing repeated downloads through NAT.</li>
    <li><strong>External APIs/SaaS</strong>: high-throughput outbound calls from private workloads.</li>
    <li><strong>Log shipping</strong>: exporting logs to external destinations through NAT.</li>
    <li><strong>Retry storms</strong>: a small outage can multiply outbound traffic and processed GB.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate GB processed (3 practical methods)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>From NAT gateway metrics</strong>: sum bytes over a representative window and scale to monthly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>From VPC Flow Logs</strong>: filter to NAT gateway ENIs and sum bytes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>From throughput charts</strong>: convert average Mbps to GB/month (good for a first pass).
    </li>
  </ol>

  </p>

  <h2>Architecture gotchas (where costs hide)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Non-prod always-on</strong>: dev/test running 730h/month creates baseline gateway-hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accidental NAT path to AWS services</strong>: traffic to AWS APIs can still go through NAT when endpoints/private access aren’t used.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-AZ routing</strong>: centralized egress patterns can introduce cross-AZ transfer in addition to NAT.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-AZ HA choices</strong>: more NAT gateways can improve locality/availability but increases gateway-hours—model the trade-off explicitly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist (do this after changes)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm gateway-hours didn’t stay flat due to unused gateways left running.</li>
    <li>Confirm GB processed dropped and identify which traffic source changed.</li>
    <li>Check for shifted costs: data transfer/cross-AZ and internet egress can move when routing changes.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: if retries still spike, the problem will return.</li>
  </ul>
