  <p>
    NAT gateway bills are often surprising because they combine a fixed hourly component with traffic-based charges. If
    you put high-throughput workloads behind NAT, costs can spike quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hours/month the NAT gateway is provisioned (usually ~730 if always on)</li>
    <li>GB/month processed through NAT (egress to the internet, software updates, external APIs)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate GB/month</h2>
  <p>
    Start from flow logs or egress monitoring. If you only have throughput charts, convert Mbps to GB/month using the
    <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>How to reduce NAT spend</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use VPC endpoints / private access for common services where applicable</li>
    <li>Cache software updates and container images</li>
    <li>Keep traffic in-region where possible</li>
  </ul>
