  <p>
    If you are building a <a href="/calculators/cdn-cost-calculator/">CDN cost calculator</a> model, the easiest mistake
    is mixing up two similar-sounding line items: <strong>origin egress</strong> and <strong>CDN bandwidth</strong>.
    They are related, but they are not the same thing.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick definitions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>CDN bandwidth (edge egress)</strong>: bytes delivered from the CDN edge to end users. This is the number
      most CDN pricing pages focus on (for example, $/GB).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin egress</strong>: bytes transferred out of your origin (object storage, load balancer, VM, or
      service) to the CDN or to other destinations. This is billed by your origin provider, not by the CDN (unless the
      CDN is also your origin).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why they differ</h2>
  <p>
    The CDN serves user traffic from cache when possible. When an object is not in cache (or is expired), the CDN pulls
    it from origin. That pull is often called <em>cache fill</em>. Cache fill contributes to origin egress, but not
    always in a 1:1 way with edge bandwidth.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>With a high cache hit rate, origin egress can be a small fraction of CDN bandwidth.</li>
    <li>With a low cache hit rate, origin egress can approach CDN bandwidth.</li>
    <li>
      Some workloads can have origin egress higher than edge bandwidth due to revalidation, multi-POP fills, or
      inefficient caching patterns.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A simple way to model costs (without double-counting)</h2>
  <p>Use separate line items and separate calculators:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Model <strong>CDN edge bandwidth</strong> with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN Bandwidth Cost</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Model <strong>CDN request fees</strong> with <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN Request Cost</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you pay for origin egress, model <strong>origin egress (cache fill)</strong> with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data Egress Cost</a> using your origin's $/GB.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Then sum those line items to get a total. If you want a single page that bundles the two major CDN line items, start
    with <a href="/calculators/cdn-cost-calculator/">CDN Cost Calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Estimating origin egress from edge bandwidth</h2>
  <p>If you do not have origin egress data yet, you can approximate it from expected cache hit rate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin egress (GB/month) ≈ CDN bandwidth (GB/month) x (1 - cache hit rate)</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is a simplification. It's a good starting point for budgeting, and you can refine it later with real metrics.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Using origin egress as CDN bandwidth</strong>: the origin egress line item may be much smaller (or larger)
      than the edge bandwidth line item.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Forgetting cache fill</strong>: your CDN might look cheap until you realize your origin is paying large
      egress charges.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mixing units</strong>: provider dashboards might use GiB while pricing pages use GB. Use{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a> to keep units consistent.
    </li>
  </ul>
