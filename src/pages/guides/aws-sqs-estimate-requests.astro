    The fastest way to budget SQS is to estimate total monthly requests. Once you have that, the cost model is usually
    straightforward.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Start from messages per month</h2>
  <p>
    If you have a steady rate, approximate:
    <br />
    <strong>messages/month ≈ messages/sec × 2,592,000</strong> (30-day month).
  </p>

  <h2>2) Multiply by requests per message</h2>
  <p>
    Use a baseline of 3, then add a buffer for retries. For example, if 10% of messages are retried once, your effective
    requests per message may be closer to 3.3–3.5 depending on behavior.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Sanity-check with a calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-sqs-cost-calculator/">AWS SQS Cost Calculator</a> and adjust “requests per message” until
    the estimate matches what you see in your metrics.
