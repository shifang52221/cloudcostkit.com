  <p>
    Cross-AZ data transfer often looks like a small per-GB rate, but it scales with total traffic. In microservice and
    data pipeline architectures, this can exceed compute for some workloads.
  </p>

  <h2>Common sources of cross-AZ traffic</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Service-to-service calls between workloads placed in different AZs.</li>
    <li>Load balancer routing patterns that send requests across AZs frequently.</li>
    <li>Cross-AZ data replication for managed databases and storage systems.</li>
    <li>Centralized logging/metrics pipelines pulling from multiple AZs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate GB/month</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start with flow logs or service metrics to identify cross-AZ flows.</li>
    <li>If you only have throughput charts, convert average Mbps to GB/month with the <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units converter</a>.</li>
    <li>Multiply the cross-AZ portion (percent of traffic that crosses AZ boundaries) by your effective $/GB rate.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/vpc-data-transfer-cost-calculator/">VPC data transfer cost calculator</a> to model the
    cross-AZ line item.
  </p>

  <h2>How to reduce cross-AZ spend (without losing availability)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Co-locate chatty dependencies in the same AZ when safe and supported (or use locality-aware routing).</li>
    <li>Reduce payload sizes and call frequency (batching, caching).</li>
    <li>Validate load balancer configuration and traffic distribution.</li>
    <li>Measure before changing: avoid trading cost for fragility unintentionally.</li>
  </ul>
