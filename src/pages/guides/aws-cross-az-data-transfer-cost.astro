  <p>
    Cross-AZ data transfer costs appear when bytes move between Availability Zones inside a region. The cost is easy to
    model once you know <strong>GB/month crossing zones</strong>, but the hard part is identifying what causes the cross-AZ
    traffic in your architecture.
  </p>

  <h2>Common causes of cross-AZ transfer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers</strong>: traffic enters one AZ and is forwarded to targets in another (cross-zone patterns).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Databases</strong>: multi-AZ replication and client connections crossing AZ boundaries.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Kubernetes</strong>: pods in AZ A calling services/endpoints in AZ B (uneven scheduling or service topology).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT gateways</strong>: workloads in one AZ using a NAT gateway in another can create cross-AZ bytes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shared services</strong>: centralized logging, proxies, or caches in a single AZ serving multi-AZ workloads.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate cross-AZ GB/month</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Start from traffic volume</strong>: total GB delivered/processed for the service boundary (API, LB, service mesh).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Estimate cross-AZ fraction</strong>: what percent of traffic crosses zones (0% if perfectly zone-local, often 5-20% in practice).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-AZ GB/month</strong> ~= total GB/month x cross-AZ fraction.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Where to get the inputs (practical)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>VPC Flow Logs</strong>: measure bytes between subnets/ENIs tagged by AZ.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancer metrics</strong>: identify uneven target distribution and cross-zone behavior windows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Kubernetes topology</strong>: compare client pod AZ vs endpoint AZ distributions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you cannot measure yet, use a conservative range (for example 10-30%) and validate later with flow logs.
  </p>

  <h2>How to reduce cross-AZ cost safely</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Keep traffic zone-local</strong>: ensure targets/endpoints are evenly spread across AZs and clients prefer same-AZ targets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid centralized single-AZ dependencies</strong>: caches, proxies, and NAT should be deployed per AZ where possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Validate LB and client behavior</strong>: confirm routing policies actually keep traffic local under load and during scale events.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Watch failure modes</strong>: some cross-AZ traffic is the "safety cost" during partial AZ failures; optimize without reducing resilience.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure cross-AZ GB/day from flow logs for at least 7 days.</li>
    <li>Confirm cross-AZ fraction during deploys and scale events (often worse than steady state).</li>
    <li>After changes, validate both cost reduction and resilience behavior during AZ degradation.</li>
  </ul>
