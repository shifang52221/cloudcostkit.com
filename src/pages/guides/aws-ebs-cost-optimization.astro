    EBS spend is often quiet but constant. Small over-provisioning across many volumes becomes a large monthly bill. The
    best savings come from right-sizing capacity and paying for performance only where it is actually needed.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Right-size GB first</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify volumes with low utilization and reduce size where safe.</li>
    <li>Forecast growth so you don't over-provision far ahead.</li>
    <li>Remove unused volumes left behind by old instances and experiments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Avoid paying for unused performance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare provisioned IOPS/throughput to actual usage.</li>
    <li>Keep a typical and peak scenario (peaks are often batch or maintenance windows).</li>
    <li>Reduce provisioned performance and validate latency/queue depth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Treat snapshots as a policy, not a default</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set retention intentionally (keep only what you need).</li>
    <li>Reduce churn where possible (churn drives snapshot growth).</li>
    <li>Audit policies and clean up unused snapshots.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate storage utilization, IOPS, throughput, and latency for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Compare peak windows (backups/migrations) separately from steady state.</li>
    <li>After changes, confirm application SLOs and storage latency remain stable.</li>
  </ul>
