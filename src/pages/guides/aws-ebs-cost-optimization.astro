  <p class="muted">
    EBS spend is usually “quiet but constant”. Small over-provisioning across many volumes becomes a big monthly bill.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Right-size GB first</h2>
  <p>
    Identify volumes with low utilization and reduce size where safe. If you grow storage steadily, forecast it so you
    don’t over-provision far ahead.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Avoid paying for unused performance</h2>
  <p>
    If your volume type bills for provisioned IOPS/throughput, compare provisioned values to actual usage. Many teams pay
    for peak performance 24/7 even though peaks are rare.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Treat snapshots as a policy, not a default</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set retention intentionally (keep only what you need).</li>
    <li>Reduce churn (avoid rewriting large files daily if possible).</li>
    <li>Audit snapshot policies and clean up unused snapshots.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Use a calculator to identify the biggest lever</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-ebs-cost-calculator/">AWS EBS Cost Calculator</a> to see whether storage or performance
    charges dominate for your scenario, then optimize the right knob.
