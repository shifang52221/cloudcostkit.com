  <p>
    EBS cost is usually not “mysterious”: it’s mostly <strong>GB-month</strong>, plus <strong>IOPS/throughput</strong>
    for some volume types, plus <strong>snapshots</strong>. The waste comes from unattached volumes, oversized volumes,
    and default performance settings that are higher than required.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 0: identify your dominant driver</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Capacity</strong>: large volumes provisioned far above actual usage.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance</strong>: provisioned IOPS/throughput set above what workloads use.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Snapshots</strong>: long retention and frequent snapshots on large changing datasets.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>High-leverage savings levers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Delete unattached volumes</strong>: orphaned volumes accumulate after instance termination and migrations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Right-size GB</strong>: reduce volume size where safe (after validating used space and growth).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Choose the right type</strong>: gp3 often provides better cost control than gp2 for many workloads.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Right-size IOPS/throughput</strong>: set based on measured utilization, not defaults.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Snapshot lifecycle</strong>: keep only what you need; avoid keeping daily snapshots forever.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common cost traps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Oversized root volumes (default AMI settings) across large fleets.</li>
    <li>Provisioned performance far above actual usage (especially for “just in case”).</li>
    <li>Snapshots without lifecycle policies, retained indefinitely.</li>
    <li>Staging/dev volumes with production-sized disks and retention policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Snapshot cost drivers (what actually increases snapshot GB)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Change rate</strong>: snapshots store changed blocks over time; write-heavy workloads can grow snapshot usage.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retention</strong>: keeping daily snapshots for months usually dominates.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Copies</strong>: copied snapshots across regions or accounts create additional stored GB.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If snapshots are a top line item, start by reviewing retention and copies before touching performance settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Right-sizing workflow (practical)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>List top volumes by GB-month cost and identify unattached volumes.</li>
    <li>For each class, measure used space, growth, and p95 IOPS/throughput.</li>
    <li>Decide: reduce size, change type (gp2 vs gp3), or reduce provisioned performance.</li>
    <li>Validate in canary, then roll across the fleet with monitoring and rollback.</li>
  </ol>

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>For each volume class, measure used space and growth rate (busy month included).</li>
    <li>Measure IOPS and throughput utilization before changing performance settings.</li>
    <li>For gp2->gp3 changes, validate latency and throughput under representative load.</li>
    <li>After snapshot policy changes, validate restore requirements (RPO/RTO) are still met.</li>
  </ul>
