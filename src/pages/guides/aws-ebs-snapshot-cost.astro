  <p>
    EBS snapshot storage is incremental, which makes it tricky to budget. You typically pay for the data that changes
    over time, retained across your snapshot retention window. A simple planning model is usually enough to avoid
    surprise bills.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: define the baseline volume size</h2>
  <p>
    Start with the provisioned volume size in GB. For large fleets, use an average volume size and count, or model a few
    representative volume classes.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: estimate daily change rate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Low-churn volumes: 0.5%–2% per day</li>
    <li>Moderate churn: 2%–5% per day</li>
    <li>High churn: 5%–15%+ per day</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Use scenarios if you’re uncertain; the goal is to understand sensitivity to churn and retention.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: model retention</h2>
  <p>
    Longer retention multiplies stored deltas. The retained “steady state” storage can be approximated as:
    <strong> volume + daily deltas x (retention days − 1)</strong>.

  <h2>How to reduce snapshot cost safely</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shorten retention for noisy/low-value snapshots.</li>
    <li>Reduce churn (move temp files, cache directories, and logs off the volume if possible).</li>
    <li>Use fewer backup copies where policies allow.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted" style="margin-top:14px">
    Validate later with billing data; snapshot behavior can differ by provider and storage implementation.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate storage utilization, IOPS, throughput, and latency for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Separate steady-state vs peak windows (backups/migrations/batch).</li>
    <li>After changes, confirm application SLOs and storage latency remain stable.</li>
  </ul>
