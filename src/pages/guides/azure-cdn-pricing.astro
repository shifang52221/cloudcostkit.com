  <p>
    CDN pricing becomes predictable when you split traffic into: <strong>edge bandwidth</strong>, <strong>edge requests</strong>,
    and <strong>origin egress</strong>. Most surprise bills come from cache misses and origin traffic (cache fill), not from
    steady-state cache hits.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Edge bandwidth (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use a representative traffic window. If you only have RPS, multiply by average response size (and model large endpoints
    separately).

  </p>

  <h2>2) Requests (per month)</h2>
  <p>
    Requests matter for lots of small objects. Convert RPS to monthly requests and ensure you match pricing units (per 10k,
    per 1M, etc).
  </p>
  <p>
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS → requests</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN request cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Origin egress (cache fill)</h2>
  <p>
    Origin egress is driven by cache misses. A practical estimate is: <strong>origin GB ≈ edge GB × (1 − hit rate)</strong>.
    Purges, deploys, and low TTLs reduce hit rate and increase cache fill.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate cache hit rate and how it changes during deploys/purges.</li>
    <li>Validate top endpoints by bytes and requests (avoid blended averages).</li>
    <li>Validate origin egress separately from edge bandwidth to avoid double-counting.</li>
  </ul>
