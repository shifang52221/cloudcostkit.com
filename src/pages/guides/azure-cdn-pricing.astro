  <p>
    CDN pricing becomes predictable when you split traffic into three drivers: <strong>edge bandwidth</strong>,{" "}
    <strong>edge requests</strong>, and <strong>origin egress</strong> (cache fill). Most surprise bills come from cache
    misses and cold-cache events, not from steady-state hits.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define the boundary (edge vs origin)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge bandwidth</strong>: bytes delivered from CDN to end users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin egress</strong>: bytes from your origin to CDN on cache miss/fill.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong>: count requests at the edge, and keep a separate estimate for origin requests if your origin pricing cares.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    In many architectures you pay for both legs: CDN edge delivery plus origin egress on cache fill.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Edge bandwidth (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use a representative traffic window. If you only have RPS, estimate transfer from response size and request volume.
    If you have a few very large endpoints (downloads, exports), model them separately.

    <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">Response transfer</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Requests (per month)</h2>
  <p>
    Requests matter for lots of small objects and API-heavy traffic. Convert RPS to monthly requests and keep pricing units
    explicit (per 10k vs per 1M).
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN request cost</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Split into at least two buckets if needed: <strong>API-like</strong> (high RPS, small payloads) and{" "}
      <strong>download-like</strong> (lower RPS, large payloads).
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep a <strong>peak scenario</strong> for bot spikes and incident traffic.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Origin egress (cache fill)</h2>
  <p>
    Origin egress is driven by cache misses. A practical estimate is:
    <strong> origin GB ≈ edge GB * (1 - hit rate)</strong>. Purges, deploys, and low TTLs reduce hit rate and increase cache
    fill.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Model large objects separately: one media/export path can dominate origin GB even when overall hit rate looks good.
    </li>
    <li>
      Track hit rate during deploys/purges. Cold cache events are often the root cause of origin spikes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge requests/month</strong> = baseline + peak
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge GB/month</strong> = requests/month * avg response size (GB) (split big endpoints separately)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin GB/month</strong> ≈ edge GB/month * (1 - hit rate)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Double-counting edge bandwidth and origin egress.</li>
    <li>Using one blended response size when a few endpoints dominate bytes.</li>
    <li>Ignoring purge/deploy behavior and cold-cache events.</li>
    <li>Mixing request pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M).</li>
    <li>Assuming hit rate is stable; it varies by path, TTL, and cache key configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate hit rate and top endpoints by bytes and requests (avoid blended averages).</li>
    <li>Validate origin egress separately from edge bandwidth.</li>
    <li>After one billing cycle, reconcile edge vs origin legs and keep a peak scenario for incident windows.</li>
  </ul>
