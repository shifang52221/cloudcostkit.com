  <p>
    Cloud CDN pricing becomes predictable when you break it down into <strong>edge bandwidth</strong>, <strong>edge requests</strong>,
    and <strong>origin egress</strong>. Most surprise bills are caused by cache misses and origin traffic (cache fill), not
    steady-state cache hits.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Edge bandwidth (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use a representative traffic window. If you only know RPS, estimate average response size and multiply by monthly
    requests. Model “big endpoints” separately to avoid blended-average errors.

  </p>

  <h2>2) Requests (per month)</h2>
  <p>
    Convert RPS to monthly requests and ensure you match pricing units (per 10k, per 1M). Requests are often small for large
    objects but large for APIs and many-small-object workloads.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Origin egress (cache fill)</h2>
  <p>
    Origin egress is driven by misses. A practical estimate is:
    <strong>origin GB ≈ edge GB × (1 − hit rate)</strong>. Purges, low TTLs, and personalized responses reduce hit rate and
    increase cache fill.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate cache hit rate and how it changes during deploys/purges.</li>
    <li>Validate top endpoints by bytes and requests (avoid blended averages).</li>
    <li>Validate origin egress separately from edge bandwidth to avoid double-counting.</li>
  </ul>
