  <p>
    Cloud CDN pricing becomes predictable when you break it into three drivers: <strong>edge bandwidth</strong>,{" "}
    <strong>edge requests</strong>, and <strong>origin egress (cache fill)</strong>. Most surprise bills are caused by cache
    misses and cold-cache events, not by steady-state hits.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define the boundary (edge vs origin)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge bandwidth</strong>: bytes delivered from CDN to end users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin egress</strong>: bytes pulled from origin to CDN on cache miss/fill.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong>: request count at the edge; keep a separate count for origin if your origin pricing cares.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Edge bandwidth (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use a representative traffic window. If you only have RPS, estimate transfer from response size and request volume. If
    you have a few very large endpoints (downloads, media), model them separately.

    <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Unit converter</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Requests (per month)</h2>
  <p>
    Convert RPS to monthly requests and keep units explicit (per 10k vs per 1M). Request fees often dominate for API-like
    traffic with small payloads.
  </p>

    <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN request fees</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Keep a <strong>peak scenario</strong> for bot spikes and incident traffic.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have many small objects per page, request counts scale faster than bandwidth.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Origin egress (cache fill)</h2>
  <p>
    Origin egress is driven by cache misses. A practical estimate is:
    <strong> origin GB ~= edge GB * (1 - hit rate)</strong>. Purges, deploys, and low TTLs reduce hit rate and increase cache
    fill.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data egress cost</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Model large objects separately: one download path can dominate origin GB even when overall hit rate looks healthy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Track cold cache events: a purge plus a large deploy can temporarily turn most traffic into cache fill.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge requests/month</strong> = baseline + peak
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge GB/month</strong> = requests/month * avg response size (GB) (split big endpoints)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin GB/month</strong> ~= edge GB/month * (1 - hit rate)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Double-counting edge bandwidth and origin egress.</li>
    <li>Using one blended response size when a few endpoints dominate bytes.</li>
    <li>Ignoring purge/deploy behavior and cold-cache events.</li>
    <li>Mixing request pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M).</li>
    <li>Assuming hit rate is stable; it varies by path, TTL, and cache key configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate cache hit rate overall and by path, and measure changes during deploys/purges.</li>
    <li>Validate top endpoints by bytes and request volume (avoid blended averages).</li>
    <li>Validate peak windows where retries or bot traffic increase requests and bandwidth.</li>
  </ul>
