  <p>
    The ECS on EC2 vs ECS on Fargate decision is usually not “which list price is lower”. It is about{" "}
    <strong>utilization</strong>, <strong>packing efficiency</strong>, and how much you pay for <strong>idle capacity</strong>.
    After compute, the winner is often decided by <strong>logs</strong>, <strong>load balancers</strong>, and{" "}
    <strong>networking</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: normalize the workload (use average, not peak)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Average running tasks over the month (baseline + busy month scenario).</li>
    <li>CPU and memory usage distribution (p50/p95), not just requests/limits.</li>
    <li>Traffic shape: steady, bursty, or scheduled down (non-prod scheduling matters).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: compute-only baseline (then stop)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Compute-only is a useful baseline, but it rarely predicts the total bill. Use it as step zero, then add the line
    items that dominate.

  <h2>Step 3: what changes the math (the real decision drivers)</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Driver</th>
        <th>EC2</th>
        <th>Fargate</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Idle capacity</td>
        <td>You pay for idle instances unless you can schedule down or pack workloads</td>
        <td>You usually pay only for running tasks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Packing efficiency</td>
        <td>High packing reduces cost dramatically</td>
        <td>Packing is per-task; fragmentation can still exist</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ops overhead</td>
        <td>You manage instances, scaling, AMIs, patching</td>
        <td>Less infra management, faster iteration</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Step 4: add the line items that often dominate ECS bills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Load balancers</strong>: hourly + capacity units for each ALB/NLB.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion + retention baseline (and scans during incidents).</li>
    <li><strong>Networking</strong>: NAT processed GB, internet egress, and cross-AZ transfer.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: EBS and snapshots for EC2 services that attach volumes.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Worked example (why utilization dominates)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If EC2 runs at 30% average utilization due to fragmentation and headroom, you are paying ~3.3× the effective compute
    you need. If you can pack to 70% utilization, the EC2 model can become very competitive.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>EC2 at 30% utilization -> effective “paid capacity” multiplier ~ 1 / 0.30 ~= 3.3×</li>
    <li>EC2 at 70% utilization -> multiplier ~ 1 / 0.70 ~= 1.4×</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Practical guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Prefer <strong>ECS on EC2</strong> when workloads are steady and you can pack well (and/or apply commitments).
    </li>
    <li>
      Prefer <strong>Fargate</strong> when workloads are spiky, you cannot keep EC2 utilization high, or you want simpler operations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Re-evaluate after measuring non-compute line items (logs, NAT, load balancers) for a real week.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure average and p95 task CPU/memory usage for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Measure how many load balancers exist and whether they are shared.</li>
    <li>Measure log ingestion GB/day and retention; validate query scan behavior during incidents.</li>
    <li>Measure NAT processed GB and egress GB for the traffic path your service actually uses.</li>
  </ul>
