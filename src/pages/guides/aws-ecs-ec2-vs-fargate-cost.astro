  <p>
    The “ECS on EC2 vs ECS on Fargate cost” decision is usually about <strong>utilization</strong> and{" "}
    <strong>operational overhead</strong>. Compute is only the baseline—networking, logs, and load balancers frequently
    decide the winner.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: normalize the workload</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Average running tasks over the month (not peak).</li>
    <li>Average CPU/memory usage (and how it changes during bursts).</li>
    <li>Traffic shape: steady, bursty, or scheduled down.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: compare compute-only first</h2>
  <p>
    Use compute-only as a baseline, then add other line items.

  </div>

  <h2>Step 3: add the line items that dominate ECS bills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Load balancers</strong>: hourly + LCU/NLCU for each ALB/NLB.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion + retention (and scan/search if applicable).</li>
    <li><strong>Networking</strong>: NAT processed traffic, egress, and cross-AZ transfer.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: EBS and snapshots for ECS on EC2 services that use volumes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Practical guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Prefer <strong>ECS on EC2</strong> when you can keep instances packed and you already manage fleets with
      commitments.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prefer <strong>ECS on Fargate</strong> when you value simplicity and your workloads have significant idle time or
      uncertain steady-state.
    </li>
    <li>Revisit after measuring average utilization and non-compute line items.</li>
  </ul>
