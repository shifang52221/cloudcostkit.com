  <p>
    Private Service Connect-style networking often charges for <strong>time</strong> (endpoint-hours) and <strong>volume</strong>
    (GB processed). Cost planning is straightforward once you split these into separate line items and validate routing.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Endpoint-hours</h2>
  <p>
    Model: <strong>endpoint count × hours per month</strong>. Environment sprawl (multiple regions and environments) can make
    endpoint-hours the dominant baseline.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Data processed (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate the traffic that uses PSC (storage, registries, databases). Treat “GB through PSC” as separate from internet
    egress to avoid double-counting.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>3) Compare against NAT/internet paths</h2>
  <p>
    Model two scenarios: public egress via NAT and private egress via PSC. In many stacks, PSC reduces security risk but can
    increase baseline costs via endpoint-hours.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate routing/DNS so traffic actually uses PSC (avoid paying for endpoints you don’t use).</li>
    <li>Validate endpoint count across environments (endpoint-hours scale with sprawl).</li>
    <li>Validate GB/month during deployments (image pulls and package downloads can spike).</li>
  </ul>
