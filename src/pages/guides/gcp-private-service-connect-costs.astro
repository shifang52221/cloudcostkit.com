  <p>
    Private Service Connect-style networking is easiest to estimate when you split it into two line items:{" "}
    <strong>time</strong> (endpoint-hours) and <strong>volume</strong> (GB processed). Then validate that your traffic
    actually uses the private path.
  </p>

  <h2>0) What to measure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint-hours</strong>: endpoint count per environment and region, multiplied by hours/month.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GB processed</strong>: baseline + peak traffic through PSC endpoints.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Alternative path</strong>: what the traffic would cost via NAT/public egress.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Endpoint-hours (baseline)</h2>
  <p>
    Model: <strong>endpoints x hours per month</strong>. Environment sprawl (prod + staging + dev, multiple regions) often
    makes endpoint-hours the dominant baseline.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Count endpoints by environment and region; that is where growth hides.</li>
    <li>Remove unused endpoints; idle endpoints still cost endpoint-hours.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Data processed (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate the traffic that uses PSC (artifact registries, storage, databases, APIs). Treat "GB through PSC" as separate
    from internet egress to avoid double-counting.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Transfer (GB/month)</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deployments can spike traffic (image pulls, artifact downloads). Model a peak month.</li>
    <li>If services are cross-region, separate the cross-region component explicitly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Compare against NAT/internet egress (two scenarios)</h2>
  <p>
    Build two estimates: a private-path estimate (PSC) and a public-path estimate (NAT + internet egress). PSC often reduces
    security risk, but it can increase baseline costs via endpoint-hours.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Reduce endpoint sprawl (the baseline lever)</h2>
  <p>
    Endpoint-hours are predictable and easy to accidentally inflate. If you have many environments and regions, add a simple
    governance rule: every endpoint must have an owner, a purpose, and a review date.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove unused endpoints after migrations (old and new paths often exist in parallel longer than planned).</li>
    <li>Consolidate endpoints where possible (avoid one-off endpoints per team/service unless required).</li>
    <li>Track endpoint inventory in IaC so drift does not create permanent baseline cost.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint-hours</strong> = endpoints x hours/month (prod + non-prod)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GB processed</strong> = baseline + peak GB/month through PSC endpoints
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Comparison</strong> = PSC scenario vs NAT/public egress scenario (avoid paying twice)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Endpoint sprawl across environments/regions (baseline grows quietly).</li>
    <li>Traffic not actually using PSC due to DNS/routing (PSC + NAT costs at the same time).</li>
    <li>Deployment spikes not modeled (container pulls and package downloads).</li>
    <li>Blending GB processed and internet egress together, hiding optimization levers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate routing/DNS so traffic actually uses PSC (avoid paying for endpoints you do not use).</li>
    <li>Validate endpoint count across environments (endpoint-hours scale with sprawl).</li>
    <li>Validate GB/month during deployments and incident windows (peaks are not averages).</li>
  </ul>
