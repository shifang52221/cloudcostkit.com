      q: "What are the main cost components for archival storage?",
      a: "Storage (GB-month) plus retrieval (GB retrieved and retrieval requests). Some classes also have minimum storage duration and early deletion fees.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why do small objects increase cost?",
      a: "Because retrieval is billed on both GB and requests. Many small-object restores can create high request counts even if total GB is modest.",

  <p>
    Archive storage is cheap for data you rarely read. But total cost depends on <strong>how often you restore</strong>
    and how your data is packaged (large objects vs many small objects).
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Stored GB-month</strong>: average stored GB over the month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retrieval GB/month</strong>: how much data you restore and read back
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retrieval requests/month</strong>: how many objects you retrieve
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Minimum duration / early deletion</strong>: if you delete/overwrite before the minimum duration
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-s3-glacier-cost-calculator/">AWS S3 Glacier / Deep Archive Cost Calculator</a> for a
    storage + retrieval model. If your workload frequently deletes or replaces objects, add minimum-duration effects to
    your estimate.
