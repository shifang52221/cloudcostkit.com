  <p>
    ECS vs EKS comparisons are often wrong because teams compare “service A” to “service B” without modeling the
    surrounding infrastructure. Use this checklist to compare consistently: normalize workload assumptions, pick the
    compute model, add platform overhead, then add the line items that dominate in production.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 0: normalize workload assumptions (the part most comparisons skip)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Average capacity</strong>: typical vCPU and memory used over a month (not peak only).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Burstiness</strong>: how often you hit peak (daily, weekly, incident-only).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Traffic shape</strong>: requests/sec and average response size (drives transfer and LB usage).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logging volume</strong>: GB/day and retention (often a separate bill).
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: pick the compute model for ECS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>ECS on EC2</strong>: pay for instance-hours (and EBS). You win when you can pack tasks efficiently.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ECS on Fargate</strong>: pay for vCPU-hours + memory GB-hours per running task. You win when you reduce idle
      running tasks.
    </li>

  <h2>Step 2: model EKS baseline and packing efficiency</h2>
  <p>
    EKS cost is usually dominated by node-hours, but the driver is “how well you pack pods into nodes” and “how many
    clusters you operate”.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Control plane</strong>: fixed hourly fee per cluster (matters for many small clusters).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Nodes</strong>: rightsize from requests and accept imperfect packing (pod limits, topology constraints).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add-ons</strong>: CNI/ingress/observability add baseline overhead on every node.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 3: add the line items that dominate both (don’t skip this)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers</strong>: hourly baseline plus capacity units for each LB.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs & metrics</strong>: ingestion + retention; high-cardinality metrics and chatty logs can become major.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Networking</strong>: NAT processed GB, cross-AZ transfer, and internet egress.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A practical decision guide (when cost tends to favor each)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>ECS tends to win</strong> when you want a smaller platform surface area, run a few predictable services,
      and can keep average running tasks low.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>EKS tends to win</strong> when you can consolidate many workloads into fewer clusters and achieve high packing
      efficiency with disciplined requests and autoscaling.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Either can lose</strong> if you sprawl clusters/LBs, ignore observability volume, or route internal traffic
      through expensive paths (NAT, cross-AZ).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing peak capacity instead of average (budgets are mostly driven by average).</li>
    <li>Ignoring cluster count: many small EKS clusters create fixed-fee and operational overhead.</li>
    <li>“One load balancer per service” patterns creating an always-on baseline bill.</li>
    <li>Missing NAT/cross-AZ transfer costs from service-to-service chatter.</li>
    <li>Assuming logs/metrics are “small” without measuring GB/day and series growth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate after you choose</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In billing/Cost Explorer, group costs by service and usage type: verify compute vs LB vs logs vs transfer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Compare “average running tasks/pods” to “peak”; optimization is often reducing idle, not shaving milliseconds.
    </li>
    <li>
      After a week, re-check: LB count, NAT processed GB, log ingestion GB/day, and cross-AZ transfer.
    </li>
  </ul>
