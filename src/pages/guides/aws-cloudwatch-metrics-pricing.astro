    Metrics costs often grow because of <strong>cardinality</strong>: the number of unique time series generated by metric
    name + label combinations. This guide explains how to estimate series count and avoid the most common pitfalls.
  </p>

  <h2>What is an “active series”?</h2>
  <p>
    A unique metric name and label set. If you add labels like <code>pod</code>, <code>container</code>, or <code>user_id</code>,
    series count can multiply quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>How to estimate series</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Start from number of services × key metrics per service.</li>
    <li>Add multiplicative labels carefully (cluster × namespace × pod × container).</li>
    <li>Validate with your monitoring backend once you have real data.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Cost-control tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Limit high-cardinality labels.</li>
    <li>Drop metrics you don’t use for alerts or dashboards.</li>
    <li>Use aggregation where possible (service-level over pod-level).</li>
  </ul>
