  <p>
    Azure Front Door is essentially “edge delivery + routing”. The estimate becomes reliable when you split traffic into:
    <strong>edge bandwidth</strong>, <strong>request volume</strong>, and <strong>origin egress (cache fill)</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Edge bandwidth (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Start with a monthly bandwidth estimate to end users. If you already have metrics, use a representative window and
    convert to GB/month. If you only have RPS, estimate average response size and multiply.

  </p>

  <h2>2) Requests (per month)</h2>
  <p>
    Convert RPS to monthly requests and model peaks separately if you have bursty traffic. Many CDN/edge products charge per
    10k/1M requests; keep units explicit to avoid order-of-magnitude errors.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Origin egress (cache fill)</h2>
  <p>
    If you cache at the edge, origin egress is roughly:
    <strong>origin GB ≈ edge GB × (1 − hit rate)</strong>. Cache misses and purges can make origin egress spike, especially
    for large objects and during deploys.

  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Double-counting edge bandwidth and origin egress (they are different legs).</li>
    <li>Using average response size for an API with a heavy tail (model top endpoints separately).</li>
    <li>Ignoring cache invalidations/purges and cold cache events (misses drive origin traffic).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate cache hit rate and estimate origin GB from misses (cache fill).</li>
    <li>Validate top endpoints by bandwidth and request volume (avoid blended averages).</li>
    <li>Validate peak periods (deploys, incidents) where retries/purges increase requests and origin traffic.</li>
  </ul>
