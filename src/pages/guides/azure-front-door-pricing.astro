  <p>
    Azure Front Door is "edge delivery + routing + (optional) caching/WAF". A reliable estimate splits costs into explicit
    drivers: <strong>edge bandwidth</strong>, <strong>request volume</strong>, <strong>origin traffic (cache fill)</strong>,
    and operational add-ons like <strong>WAF/rules</strong> and <strong>logging</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define the boundary (edge vs origin)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge bandwidth</strong>: bytes delivered from Front Door to end users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin egress</strong>: bytes from your origin to Front Door on cache fill (cache misses).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong>: request count at the edge; keep a separate count for origin if your origin pricing cares.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">Most "surprise bills" are cache miss spikes (origin egress), not steady-state edge delivery.</p>

  <h2>1) Edge bandwidth (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Start with monthly bandwidth to end users. If you already have metrics, use a representative window (not just a good
    day) and convert to GB/month. If you only have RPS, estimate response sizes and multiply by request volume.

    <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Unit converter</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Split out any "heavy tail" endpoints (downloads, exports, media) instead of blending one average response size.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep a <strong>peak scenario</strong> (bot traffic, incident traffic, marketing spikes) to avoid underestimating.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Requests (per month)</h2>
  <p>
    Convert RPS to monthly requests and model peaks separately if you have bursty traffic. Keep units explicit (per 10k vs
    per 1M) and include retries/timeouts, which multiply both request count and bandwidth.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/api-request-cost-calculator/">Request cost</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you use rules/rewrites/routing, keep a separate "rules touched" estimate (not every request triggers complex
      rules).
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have multiple hostnames and routes, track them separately: traffic distribution changes which paths cache well.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Origin egress (cache fill)</h2>
  <p>
    If you cache at the edge, origin egress is driven by misses. A practical estimate is:
    <strong>origin GB ~= edge GB * (1 - hit rate)</strong>. Purges, deploys, and low TTLs reduce hit rate and can cause
    short-lived origin spikes.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data egress cost</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Model large objects separately: one download path can dominate origin GB even when overall hit rate looks healthy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Track "cold cache" events: a full purge plus a large deployment can temporarily turn most traffic into origin fills.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Logging (often the hidden bill)</h2>
  <p>
    Access logs and diagnostics can become significant at scale. Treat logging as its own pipeline:{" "}
    <strong>events * bytes/event</strong> becomes <strong>GB ingested</strong>, then retention and query scans.
  </p>

    <a href="/calculators/log-retention-storage-cost-calculator/">Retention storage</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/log-search-scan-cost-calculator/">Search/scan</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge requests/month</strong> = baseline + peak (include retries)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge GB/month</strong> = requests/month * avg response size (split top endpoints)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin GB/month</strong> ~= edge GB/month * (1 - hit rate) (model purge/deploy periods separately)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Log GB/month</strong> = log events/month * bytes/event (sample real payloads)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Double-counting edge bandwidth and origin egress (they are different legs).</li>
    <li>Using one blended response size when a few endpoints dominate bytes.</li>
    <li>Ignoring cache invalidations/purges and cold cache events (misses drive origin traffic).</li>
    <li>Forgetting logging volume (verbose logs per request can dominate).</li>
    <li>Not modeling peaks (bots/incidents/releases) that multiply requests and cache misses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate cache hit rate overall and by path, then estimate origin GB from misses.</li>
    <li>Validate top endpoints by bytes and request volume (avoid blended averages).</li>
    <li>Validate peak periods (deploys/incidents) where retries/purges increase requests and origin traffic.</li>
    <li>Validate log payload size by sampling real logs, then multiply by request volume.</li>
  </ul>
