    RDS backup costs are commonly billed as <strong>backup storage (GB-month)</strong>. The hard part is not pricing - it
    is estimating how much backup data accumulates with retention and churn.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Estimate daily changed data (churn)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use engine metrics, binlog/WAL volume, or write throughput as a proxy.</li>
    <li>Model bursty periods (batch jobs) separately from steady state.</li>
    <li>If unsure, estimate a low and high churn scenario.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Multiply by retention</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    First-pass planning model: <strong>backup GB</strong> is roughly <strong>daily changed GB x retention days</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a planning approximation. Real snapshot behavior depends on engine/storage, but this model is usually
    directionally correct for budgeting.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: Sanity-check with real snapshot sizes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Look at snapshot sizes and growth over time.</li>
    <li>Confirm whether manual snapshots (long-term) are accumulating.</li>
    <li>Check for retention differences across environments and accounts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn GB-month into dollars</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-rds-cost-calculator/">AWS RDS Cost Calculator</a> and set the backup storage input to
    your estimated <strong>backup GB-month</strong>. Pair it with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">DB storage growth</a> for multi-month scenarios.
