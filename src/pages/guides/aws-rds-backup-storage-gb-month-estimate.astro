  <p class="muted">
    RDS backup costs are commonly billed as <strong>backup storage (GB-month)</strong>. The hard part is not pricing - it
    is estimating how much backup data accumulates with retention and churn.
  </p>

  <h2>Method A (best): Start from billing data if you already have usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In Cost Explorer, filter <strong>Service</strong> to Amazon RDS.</li>
    <li>Group by <strong>Usage type</strong> and identify the backup/snapshot storage line items.</li>
    <li>Take a representative 30-day window and treat the observed backup GB-month as the baseline.</li>
    <li>Use churn × retention only to explain or forecast changes (new retention policy, new workload, migration).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method B (planning): Estimate daily changed data (churn)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use engine metrics, binlog/WAL volume, or write throughput as a proxy.</li>
    <li>Model bursty periods (batch jobs) separately from steady state.</li>
    <li>If unsure, estimate a low and high churn scenario.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    What you want is a <strong>GB/day changed</strong> number. Even a rough range (5–10 GB/day vs 50–100 GB/day) is enough
    to make retention decisions defensible.
  </p>

  <h2>Method B step 2: Multiply by retention (steady-state backup footprint)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    First-pass planning model: <strong>backup GB</strong> is roughly <strong>daily changed GB x retention days</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This model estimates the <strong>steady-state</strong> backup storage footprint after retention “fills up”. It’s a
    planning approximation, but it’s usually directionally correct for budgeting and for comparing retention policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Method B step 3: Add long-term snapshots separately</h2>
  <p>
    If you keep weekly/monthly manual snapshots (or use AWS Backup for long-term retention), model them as a separate
    bucket. In early planning, assume each long-term snapshot is “close to” the DB size at that time and tighten the
    estimate once you can observe real snapshot growth.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 4: Sanity-check with real snapshot sizes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Look at snapshot sizes and growth over time.</li>
    <li>Confirm whether manual snapshots (long-term) are accumulating.</li>
    <li>Check for retention differences across environments and accounts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked example (make retention trade-offs visible)</h2>
  <p>
    If churn is <strong>20 GB/day</strong> and operational retention is <strong>14 days</strong>, a first-pass estimate is{" "}
    <strong>~280 GB</strong> of backup storage at steady state (20 × 14). If you extend retention to 35 days, the same
    workload becomes ~700 GB. This is why retention changes can move costs even when DB size is stable.
  </p>

  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using DB size as the backup estimate (backup is driven by churn and retention).</li>
    <li>Ignoring manual snapshots created during incident response or migrations.</li>
    <li>Assuming dev/staging retention is “cheap” because the instance is small.</li>
    <li>Forgetting cross-region/cross-account snapshot copies in the total footprint.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn GB-month into dollars</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-rds-cost-calculator/">AWS RDS Cost Calculator</a> and set the backup storage input to
    your estimated <strong>backup GB-month</strong>. Pair it with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">DB storage growth</a> for multi-month scenarios.
  </p>

  <h2>How to validate (so the estimate holds up)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use Cost Explorer to confirm the backup storage line item for Amazon RDS over a representative month.</li>
    <li>Correlate spikes with retention changes, incident windows, backfills, or snapshot copy jobs.</li>
    <li>After policy changes, compare backup GB-month before/after (same workload window) to confirm impact.</li>
  </ul>
