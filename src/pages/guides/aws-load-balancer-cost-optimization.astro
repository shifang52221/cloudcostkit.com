    Load balancer bills scale with always-on hours and usage. Most savings come from reducing LB count and reducing unit
    usage (LCU/NLCU).
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce the number of load balancers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Consolidate services behind shared ingress where feasible.</li>
    <li>Avoid “one LB per microservice” unless it’s required.</li>
    <li>Remove unused LBs left behind by experiments and migrations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce unit usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce payload sizes (compression, avoid huge downloads through LB).</li>
    <li>Fix retry storms and timeouts that multiply requests.</li>
    <li>Reduce chatty patterns and excessive short-lived connections.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Validate with a calculator</h2>
  <p>

    LB count or unit usage changes your monthly bill.
