    Load balancer bills usually scale with always-on hours and usage. Most savings come from reducing LB count and
    reducing capacity-unit drivers (LCU/NLCU).
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce the number of load balancers (LB-hours)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Consolidate services behind shared ingress where feasible.</li>
    <li>Avoid one load balancer per microservice unless it is required.</li>
    <li>Remove unused load balancers left behind by experiments and migrations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce unit usage (LCU / NLCU)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix retry storms and timeouts that multiply requests.</li>
    <li>Reduce chatty patterns and excessive short-lived connections.</li>
    <li>Reduce payload sizes (compression, avoid large downloads through the load balancer where possible).</li>
    <li>Use caching (CDN) for static assets so fewer bytes go through the load balancer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Validate the estimate (before/after)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Track LB count and hours (how many load balancers are always on).</li>
    <li>Track request rate, connection rate, and bytes processed (the capacity-unit drivers).</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: spikes often come from retries and bot traffic.</li>
  </ul>
