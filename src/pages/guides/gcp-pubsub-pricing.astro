  <p>
    Pub/Sub estimation is mostly “count the deliveries”. The biggest mistakes are underestimating retries and forgetting
    fan-out: one publish can result in multiple deliveries across subscriptions.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Publish volume (per month)</h2>
  <p>
    Start with messages/second (or messages/day) and convert to monthly volume. If traffic is bursty, model peaks separately.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Fan-out and delivery attempts</h2>
  <p>
    If a topic has N subscriptions, one publish results in N deliveries. If delivery attempts average 1.2 due to retries,
    your true deliveries are: <strong>publishes × subscriptions × attempts</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Payload size and transfer</h2>
  <p>
    Payload size matters if you move large messages. Multiply average payload size by deliveries to estimate monthly GB moved.
    If subscribers are cross-region or external, model egress separately.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate retry rates and DLQ/replay patterns (deliveries, not just publishes).</li>
    <li>Validate fan-out (subscriptions) for each topic.</li>
    <li>Validate payload size distribution (avoid assuming “small messages”).</li>
  </ul>
