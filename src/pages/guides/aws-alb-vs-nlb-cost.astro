    a: "NLB can be cheaper for high connection volume patterns and simpler Layer 4 forwarding, but you must still model bytes processed and peak connection behavior.",

  <p>
    ALB vs NLB cost comparisons are easiest when you break the bill into two pieces: <strong>fixed hourly</strong> and{" "}
    <strong>capacity-unit usage</strong> (LCU for ALB, NLCU for NLB). The winner is usually driven by your traffic
    pattern: connections, bytes processed, and (for ALB) rule evaluations.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>LB-hours (how many load balancers, how many hours/month)</li>
    <li>Capacity units per hour (average and peak)</li>
    <li>Bytes processed and connection patterns (often the biggest drivers)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 1: estimate LCU/NLCU from metrics</h2>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 2: estimate monthly cost</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have average units/hour, plug it into a cost calculator with your region pricing.

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ignoring peak hours (a small number of peak hours can dominate).</li>
    <li>Using request count but forgetting payload size (bytes processed).</li>
    <li>For ALB, forgetting rule evaluations for complex routing setups.</li>
  </ul>
