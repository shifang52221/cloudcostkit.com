  <p>
    ALB vs NLB cost comparisons are easiest when you break the bill into two pieces: <strong>fixed hourly</strong> and{" "}
    <strong>capacity-unit usage</strong> (LCU for ALB, NLCU for NLB). The winner is usually driven by your traffic
    pattern: connections, bytes processed, and (for ALB) rule evaluations.

  <h2>Quick decision guide</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Cost is not the only decision factor, but it changes which drivers you need to measure. Use this table to decide what
    to model first.

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Question</th>
        <th>Leaning ALB (L7)</th>
        <th>Leaning NLB (L4)</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Do you need L7 routing features?</td>
        <td>Host/path-based routing, rules, HTTP features.</td>
        <td>Simple TCP/UDP forwarding, minimal L7 behavior.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>What dominates your traffic?</td>
        <td>Moderate connections, many small HTTP requests.</td>
        <td>High connection rates or large byte throughput.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Biggest modeling risk</td>
        <td>Rule evaluations and peak request patterns.</td>
        <td>Peak connections/flows and bytes processed.</td>

  </table>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>LB-hours (how many load balancers, how many hours/month)</li>
    <li>Capacity units per hour (average and peak)</li>
    <li>Bytes processed and connection patterns (often the biggest drivers)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where to get the numbers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong>: load balancer request count and average response size (for bytes processed).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Connections</strong>: active connections and new connections (peak and average matter).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rules (ALB)</strong>: if you rely on complex routing, validate whether rule evaluation volume is material
      for your traffic.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Practical tip: if you only have RPS and average payload size, estimate bytes processed as{" "}
    <code>GB/month ≈ RPS × bytes/response × seconds/month ÷ 1e9</code>, then validate against real metrics.

  <h2>Step 1: estimate LCU/NLCU from metrics</h2>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 2: estimate monthly cost</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have average units/hour, plug it into a cost calculator with your region pricing.

  </div>

  <h2>Example comparison (directional)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use one representative hour (and one peak hour). For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Average: 250 RPS, 40 KB response → estimate bytes/hour and capacity units/hour.</li>
    <li>Peak: 1,500 RPS for 2 hours/day → model peak separately because it can dominate capacity-unit charges.</li>
    <li>Then add fixed hourly costs (LB-hours) for both options.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ignoring peak hours (a small number of peak hours can dominate).</li>
    <li>Using request count but forgetting payload size (bytes processed).</li>
    <li>For ALB, forgetting rule evaluations for complex routing setups.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When ALB tends to win</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You need L7 features and can consolidate behind fewer load balancers.</li>
    <li>Traffic is many small requests with moderate connection rates.</li>
    <li>Rule sets are simple (or rule evaluation driver is not dominant).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When NLB tends to win</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You don’t need L7 features and want minimal processing overhead.</li>
    <li>You have very high connection/flow patterns and simple forwarding.</li>
    <li>Throughput/bytes processed is the main driver and you can measure it accurately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
