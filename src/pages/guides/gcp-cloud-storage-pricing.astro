  <p>
    GCS-like object storage pricing becomes predictable when you separate it into four buckets:
    <strong>GB-month</strong>, <strong>operations</strong>, <strong>retrieval rules</strong>, and <strong>egress</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>Use average stored GB and split by storage class if you know the mix.</p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object storage cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Operations (GET/PUT/LIST)</h2>
  <p>
    Operations are the main driver for “lots of small objects” workloads. For large objects and CDN-backed delivery,
    operations are often small compared to egress.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Retrieval and minimum duration rules</h2>
  <p>
    Colder classes often have retrieval fees and minimum storage durations. Model retrieval GB and retrieval requests
    separately, and validate any early-deletion penalties.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Outbound transfer (egress)</h2>
  <p>
    Egress is frequently the surprise line item. Split internet egress vs cross-region and keep CDN edge bandwidth separate
    from origin egress (cache fill).
  </p>

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate storage class mix and lifecycle transitions (hot → cold → archive).</li>
    <li>Validate request pricing units and whether requests are charged per 1k/10k/1M.</li>
    <li>Validate origin egress separately from CDN edge bandwidth to avoid double-counting.</li>
  </ul>
