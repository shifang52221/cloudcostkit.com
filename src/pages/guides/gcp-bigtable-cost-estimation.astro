  <p>
    Bigtable-like systems are capacity-planned: you pay for provisioned throughput capacity plus stored data. The main risk
    is sizing from averages and ignoring peaks and hotspots.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Compute capacity (node-hours)</h2>
  <p>
    Model baseline nodes and peak nodes separately. Peak demand and hotspot behavior can force higher node counts than
    average throughput would suggest.

  </p>

  <h2>2) Storage (GB-month) and growth</h2>
  <p>
    Use average stored GB and model growth. If you keep multiple versions or long retention, growth can be faster than
    expected.

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">Storage growth model</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Network transfer</h2>
  <p>
    If clients are outside the region or you replicate across regions, include outbound transfer as a separate line.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak throughput and hotspot risk (hot partitions can force higher capacity).</li>
    <li>Validate storage growth and retention/versioning assumptions.</li>
    <li>Validate cross-region access patterns and billable transfer boundaries.</li>
  </ul>
