  <p>
    Bigtable-like systems are capacity planned. Your bill is driven by provisioned throughput capacity plus stored data, and
    it becomes expensive when you are forced to over-provision for peaks or hotspots. This guide gives a simple model you can
    validate.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Identify the workload shape (what forces capacity)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Read/write throughput</strong>: baseline vs peak (batch jobs and backfills are peak).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hot keys / hotspots</strong>: uneven key distribution forces more capacity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Latency targets</strong>: stricter tail latency often implies more headroom.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Provisioned capacity (node-hours)</h2>
  <p>
    Model baseline nodes and peak nodes separately. If peak is rare, do not pay for it 24/7; if peak is frequent, you should
    treat peak as the real baseline.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/compute-instance-cost-calculator/">Compute cost model</a> (generic monthly capacity pricing).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Keep <strong>baseline</strong> and <strong>peak</strong> node counts as two explicit scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
      If one job drives peak, model that job separately (duration per day/week).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Storage (GB-month) and growth</h2>
  <p>
    Storage estimation is about average GB across the month, including growth. If you retain multiple versions or keep long
    TTLs, storage grows faster than most teams expect.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">Storage growth model</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Model data retention and any versioning explicitly (retention is a multiplier).
    </li>
    <li>
      Validate compaction/GC behavior (retention settings and churn affect stored size).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Network transfer (billable boundaries)</h2>
  <p>
    If clients are outside the region, or you replicate/serve across regions, include outbound transfer as a separate line.
    Transfer often becomes meaningful when you add multi-region patterns.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">Cross-region transfer</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline node-hours</strong> = baseline nodes × hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak node-hours</strong> = (peak nodes - baseline nodes) × peak hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stored GB-month</strong> = average stored GB across the month (include growth)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer GB/month</strong> = cross-region/internet bytes (if applicable)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ignoring hotspots (hot keys force capacity above average throughput).</li>
    <li>Paying for peak capacity 24/7 even if peak is a short batch window.</li>
    <li>Not modeling retention/versioning (stored GB grows quietly).</li>
    <li>Missing cross-region transfer when adding DR or global clients.</li>
    <li>Not validating with real workload traces (good-day averages hide tail risk).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak read/write throughput and identify peak drivers (batch jobs, backfills).</li>
    <li>Validate hotspot risk (key distribution, top partitions) and fix the schema before scaling blindly.</li>
    <li>Validate storage growth and retention (including churn and compaction behavior).</li>
    <li>Validate where clients are (same-region vs cross-region) and which legs are billable.</li>
  </ul>
