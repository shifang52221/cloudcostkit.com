  <p>
    Bandwidth is a top source of surprise cloud bills. The core strategy is to split traffic into destinations and validate
    boundaries: <strong>internet egress</strong>, <strong>cross-region transfer</strong>, and <strong>origin egress to CDN</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Break down traffic by destination</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To the internet (end users, third-party APIs, SaaS)</li>
    <li>Cross-region (replication, multi-region services, DR)</li>
    <li>To a CDN origin (cache fill, misses)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Convert your metrics to GB/month</h2>
  <p>
    If you have Mbps charts, convert to GB/month using a representative average. If you have request rates, estimate average
    response size and multiply by requests.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Apply an effective blended rate (for planning)</h2>
  <p>
    For budgeting, it’s acceptable to use a blended effective rate per GB and refine later. The key is to avoid
    double-counting (e.g., counting CDN edge bandwidth as origin egress).

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate what is billed as egress vs internal traffic (don’t assume all outbound is billed equally).</li>
    <li>Validate CDN origin egress separately from edge bandwidth and cache hit rate behavior.</li>
    <li>Validate units (GB vs GiB) and time windows (monthly vs rolling windows).</li>
  </ul>
