  <p>
    Bandwidth is a top source of surprise cloud bills. The core strategy is to split traffic into destinations and validate
    boundaries: <strong>internet egress</strong>, <strong>cross-region transfer</strong>, and <strong>origin egress to CDN</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Azure egress inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Destination zone</strong>: Zone 1/2/3 pricing tiers.</li>
    <li><strong>GB/month</strong>: baseline and peak transfer.</li>
    <li><strong>Free allowances</strong>: subtract any free tiers first.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>1) Break down traffic by destination (define the boundary)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To the internet (end users, partners, third-party APIs, SaaS)</li>
    <li>Cross-region (replication, multi-region services, DR)</li>
    <li>To a CDN origin (cache fill, misses, revalidation)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Most budgeting mistakes are boundary mistakes: counting the same GB twice, or pricing the wrong path with a blended rate.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Estimate GB/month (pick the best method you can)</h2>
  <h3>Method A: From billing exports (best for budgets)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify outbound transfer usage types and sum by month.</li>
    <li>Break down by region and by service (one noisy service can dominate egress).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Method B: From throughput charts (good first pass)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Convert Mbps to GB/month with the <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>.</li>
    <li>Apply a boundary share (internet vs cross-region vs CDN origin) and test low/medium/high sensitivity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Method C: From requests and payload size</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>requests/month * avg response size = transfer volume (split large endpoints separately)</li>
    <li>
      Tools: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">Response transfer</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Apply an effective rate (for planning)</h2>
  <p>
    For budgeting, it is acceptable to use a blended effective rate per GB and refine later. The key is to avoid
    double-counting (for example, counting CDN edge bandwidth as origin egress).

  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet egress</strong> = GB/month delivered to end users (separate CDN bandwidth from origin egress)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CDN origin egress</strong> = cache misses/month * object size (GB) + revalidation traffic
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-region</strong> = replication GB/month + cross-region reads GB/month
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Double-counting CDN bandwidth and origin egress as the same GB.</li>
    <li>Mixing regions and applying one $/GB to multiple transfer paths.</li>
    <li>Unit mistakes: GB vs GiB and Mbps vs MB/s.</li>
    <li>Ignoring peak events (backfills, audits, incidents) that dominate a month.</li>
    <li>Assuming all outbound is billed equally (internal vs internet vs cross-region differ).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reconcile your modeled GB/month boundaries against one real billing cycle.</li>
    <li>Spot-check the top destinations/services to confirm the boundary mapping is correct.</li>
    <li>Keep a separate peak scenario for backfills and incident windows.</li>
  </ul>
