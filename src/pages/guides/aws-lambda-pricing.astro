    Lambda pricing can look simple, but budgets get surprised by the surrounding line items: logging, data transfer, and
    downstream services (databases, queues, storage).
  </p>

  <h2>1) Start with the two core line items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Requests</strong>: billed per invocation (often quoted per 1M requests).</li>
    <li><strong>Compute</strong>: billed as <strong>GB-seconds</strong> (duration × memory).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Use the <a href="/calculators/aws-lambda-cost-calculator/">AWS Lambda Cost Calculator</a> to model both with your own
    pricing assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Model duration with a range, not a single number</h2>
  <p>
    Duration usually has a long tail. For planning, model <strong>p50</strong> and <strong>p95</strong> (or “typical” and
    “busy hour”) to understand sensitivity.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Don’t forget memory and over-allocation</h2>
  <p>
    Lambda compute scales with configured memory, even if your function rarely uses it. If you over-allocate memory,
    GB-seconds (and cost) increase directly.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Common “hidden” Lambda-adjacent costs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Logging</strong>: ingestion + retention storage; large JSON logs add up quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data transfer</strong>: internet egress and cross-AZ/region patterns depending on architecture.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Downstream services</strong>: DynamoDB/RDS/S3/SQS/SNS can dominate total cost in real workloads.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>5) Sanity-check with unit economics</h2>
  <p>
    Convert to “cost per 1M requests” or “cost per request” for your expected duration and memory. This makes it easier
    to compare serverless vs container/VM options.
