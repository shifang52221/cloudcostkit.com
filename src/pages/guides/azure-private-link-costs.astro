  <p>
    Private Link-style networking typically charges for <strong>time</strong> (endpoint-hours) and <strong>volume</strong>
    (GB processed). The decision is often a trade-off between security posture and cost, but you can model it with a simple
    breakdown.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Endpoint-hours</h2>
  <p>
    Start with: <strong>number of endpoints × hours per month</strong>. Environment sprawl (dev/stage/prod, multiple regions)
    can make endpoint-hours the dominant line item.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Data processed (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate how much data flows through private endpoints. If you access storage, registries, or databases privately,
    processed GB can be significant.

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Transfer cost model (GB/month)</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Compare to NAT + internet egress</h2>
  <p>
    For cost comparisons, model two scenarios:
    <strong>(A)</strong> internet egress via NAT and public endpoints, and <strong>(B)</strong> private endpoint traffic.
    Then compare monthly baselines and how they scale with GB.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate what traffic actually uses Private Link vs public endpoints (routing/DNS matters).</li>
    <li>Validate environment count and endpoint count (endpoint-hours scale with sprawl).</li>
    <li>Validate GB/month and peak windows (deployments can spike registry pulls).</li>
  </ul>
