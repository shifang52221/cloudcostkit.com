  <p>
    Private Link-style networking typically charges for <strong>time</strong> (endpoint-hours) and <strong>volume</strong>
    (data processed). The decision is often driven by security posture and architecture, but you can model it with a simple
    breakdown and validate it with real traffic.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Count endpoints the right way (avoid sprawl)</h2>
  <p>
    Start with an inventory. Private endpoints tend to multiply as teams add environments and regions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Environments</strong>: prod, staging, dev (and any isolated tenants).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Regions</strong>: active-active or multi-region DR can double or triple endpoint count.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Services</strong>: storage, registries, key vaults, databases, messaging.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Endpoint-hours scale with count, not with traffic. A low-traffic endpoint still costs hours.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Endpoint-hours (baseline)</h2>
  <p>
    The baseline is: <strong>number of endpoints × hours per month</strong>. If you have many small environments, endpoint
    hours can dominate the bill even if data processed is low.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Data processed (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate how much data flows through private endpoints. The common dominant flows are registry pulls, storage downloads,
    and any large artifacts accessed privately.

    <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress model (GB/month)</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Registry pulls</strong>: node churn and deploys create peaks; model baseline + peak.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage access</strong>: large downloads are often few endpoints but big bytes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Database traffic</strong>: usually smaller bytes, but can be constant and high-frequency.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Compare scenarios: Private Link vs NAT/public</h2>
  <p>
    For cost comparisons, model two scenarios for the <em>same traffic</em>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>A) Public endpoint via NAT</strong>: NAT hours + NAT throughput + any internet egress charges.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>B) Private endpoint</strong>: endpoint-hours + endpoint processed GB (plus any remaining egress for other traffic).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">

  </p>

  <h2>4) Pitfalls that create double-paying</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>DNS mismatch</strong>: endpoint exists but traffic resolves to the public hostname and still uses NAT.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Partial rollout</strong>: some workloads use private endpoints, others still use public endpoints.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-region hairpins</strong>: traffic crosses regions unexpectedly; model those transfer legs separately.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint sprawl</strong>: endpoints created "just in case" across many VNets and environments.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoints</strong> = count by env/region/service
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint-hours</strong> = endpoints × hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Processed GB/month</strong> = sum of private flows (baseline + peak)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Comparison</strong> = scenario A (NAT/public) vs scenario B (private endpoint)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate DNS: private zones and actual resolution from workloads.</li>
    <li>Validate routing: confirm which subnets reach the service via the private endpoint.</li>
    <li>Measure bytes: find top private flows (registries, storage) and confirm baseline vs peak.</li>
    <li>After changes, verify you reduced NAT/public traffic rather than adding an endpoint on top of it.</li>
  </ul>
