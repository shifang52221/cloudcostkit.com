  <p>
    Registry storage cost is usually driven by <strong>how many images you keep</strong> and <strong>how large they
    are</strong>. You can get a good estimate with a simple average model.
  </p>

  <h2>Fast model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Stored GB-month ≈ avg image size (GB) x images retained (count)</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Compute retained images per repo: tags kept x number of repos.</li>
    <li>Adjust for multi-arch images if you store separate variants per architecture.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Better model (with rebuilds)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you push N new images/day and retain D days, retained images ≈ N x D.</li>
    <li>Multiply by average image size to get stored GB.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn storage into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-ecr-cost-calculator/">AWS ECR Cost Calculator</a> with your stored GB-month estimate and
    your effective $/GB-month.
