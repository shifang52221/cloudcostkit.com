    For SES pricing, the key input is emails per month. Build the estimate from your product flows and marketing
    calendar, then add a buffer for retries and duplicates.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: Transactional emails (product-driven)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Receipts/confirmations: orders/month x emails per order.</li>
    <li>Password resets/signups: events/month x emails per event.</li>
    <li>Alerts/notifications: events/month x recipients (if you notify multiple recipients).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: Marketing emails (campaign-driven)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recipients per campaign x campaigns per month.</li>
    <li>Segment variants and A/B tests can multiply sends.</li>
    <li>Include test sends if they are significant.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retries and duplicates</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a retry factor if you resend on timeouts or failures.</li>
    <li>Incident alert storms can spike volume (and cost) for a month.</li>
    <li>Dedupe message IDs so retries do not generate duplicates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn volume into cost</h2>
