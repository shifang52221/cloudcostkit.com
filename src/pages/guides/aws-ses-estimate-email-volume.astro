  <p>
    SES budgets depend on one input: <strong>emails per month</strong>. The trick is that “normal week” and “incident week”
    behave very differently. This guide gives you a simple model for baseline volume plus a peak/incident factor so you
    don’t get surprised.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: split volume by intent (because variability differs)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transactional</strong>: receipts, signups, password resets, security notifications</li>
    <li><strong>Product notifications</strong>: workflow alerts, digests, reminders</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing</strong>: campaigns, newsletters, onboarding sequences</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method A: transactional volume from user actions (baseline)</h2>
  <p>
    A defendable baseline is built from events you already track.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Orders</strong>: orders/month × emails per order</li>
    <li><strong>Signups</strong>: signups/month × emails per signup flow</li>
    <li><strong>Password resets</strong>: resets/month × emails per reset</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: notification events/month × recipients per event</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you don’t have events broken out yet, start with MAU × avg emails per user and refine later.
  </p>

  <h2>Method B: marketing volume from campaign calendar</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Campaign sends</strong>: recipients per campaign × campaigns/month</li>
    <li><strong>Variants</strong>: A/B tests and segment splits multiply sends</li>
    <li><strong>Test sends</strong>: internal tests and previews (small, but include if frequent)</li>
    <li><strong>Resends</strong>: resend-to-non-openers can add a predictable extra %</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: add the “retry/duplicate” factor (the common spike driver)</h2>
  <p>
    Real systems resend. Your goal is to model it explicitly.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retry factor</strong>: timeouts and transient failures cause resend attempts</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate factor</strong>: bugs or race conditions send multiple emails for one event</li>
    <li><strong>Alert storm factor</strong>: incidents trigger high-frequency notifications</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Practical approach: keep two scenarios: baseline (e.g., +3–10%) and incident month (e.g., +30–200%) depending on your product.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: sanity checks (catch bad assumptions fast)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the estimate match your historical “emails/day” shape (weekday vs weekend)?</li>
    <li>Is marketing bursty (campaign days) vs transactional steady?</li>
    <li>Are you double-counting recipients (multiple recipients per event)?</li>
    <li>Do you have a “silent resend” job that retries failed deliveries in bulk?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked example (structure)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Transactional: 200k orders/month × 1 email/order = 200k</li>
    <li>Password resets: 30k/month × 1 = 30k</li>
    <li>Notifications: 100k events/month × 2 recipients = 200k</li>
    <li>Marketing: 2 campaigns/month × 500k recipients = 1,000k</li>
    <li>Baseline subtotal = 1.43M emails/month</li>
    <li>Add +5% retry/duplicate baseline → 1.50M</li>
    <li>Incident month scenario: +50% alerts/retries → 2.15M</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn volume into cost</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-ses-cost-calculator/">AWS SES cost calculator</a> with your baseline and incident volume.
  </p>

  <h2>How to validate with real data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick a representative week of send logs/metrics and compute average daily sends.</li>
    <li>Validate separately for transactional vs marketing (their curves differ).</li>
    <li>Check resend/duplicate rate by message idempotency keys or provider event logs.</li>
  </ul>
