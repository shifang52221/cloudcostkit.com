  <p>
    Fargate pricing is easiest to model as <strong>capacity x time</strong>: you pay for vCPU-hours and memory GB-hours
    for running tasks. The hard part is estimating <strong>average</strong> running tasks over the month and remembering
    the non-compute line items that show up in real bills.

  <h2>What to include (minimum viable cost model)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Compute</strong>: vCPU-hours + memory GB-hours (tasks x vCPU/memory x hours).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers</strong>: hourly baseline + capacity units if you front services with ALB/NLB.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion GB/day + retention (and query/scan costs if you use them).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Networking</strong>: NAT processed GB, cross-AZ transfer, and internet egress.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 1: estimate average running tasks (the variable that drives most cost)</h2>
  <p>
    Most services have a peak and an average. Monthly cost follows the <em>average</em>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Always-on service</strong>: average tasks ~ your steady desired count.</li>
    <li><strong>Autoscaled service</strong>: estimate average from traffic shape (weekday vs weekend, day vs night).</li>
    <li><strong>Batch/worker</strong>: average tasks comes from queue depth and processing rate (bursts then idle).</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: compute vCPU-hours and GB-hours</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick vCPU and memory per task (from your task definition).</li>
    <li>Pick average running tasks for the month.</li>
    <li>Multiply by hours/month (730 for always-on, less for scheduled workloads).</li>
    <li>Multiply by region $/vCPU-hour and $/GB-hour.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Step 3: model the three "hidden" bills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers</strong>: count always-on LBs, then add capacity unit assumptions for typical traffic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong>: estimate GB/day and retention; verbose JSON logs can dwarf compute.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT/egress</strong>: private tasks calling public endpoints (or AWS APIs without endpoints) can create large NAT processed GB.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Compute</strong> = avg tasks x (vCPU per task x 730) x $/vCPU-h + avg tasks x (GB per task x 730) x $/GB-h
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>LB</strong> = (count of LBs x hours) + (capacity units x hours)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong> = ingestion GB/day x days + retention storage baseline
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Networking</strong> = NAT processed GB + cross-AZ GB + internet egress GB
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using peak tasks instead of average tasks (overestimates compute, hides the real lever).</li>
    <li>Ignoring LB count and capacity units (one-per-service patterns create baseline spend).</li>
    <li>Assuming logs are "free" and discovering ingestion + retention as a top driver.</li>
    <li>Routing internal AWS calls through NAT by accident (processed GB grows quietly).</li>
    <li>Forgetting that non-prod rarely needs 730 hours/month.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate after the first month</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare billed vCPU-hours/GB-hours to your modeled average tasks.</li>
    <li>Check the top non-compute drivers: LB, logs, NAT processed GB, and cross-AZ transfer.</li>
    <li>Re-check after incidents and deploys: short spikes that happen often become monthly baseline.</li>
  </ul>
