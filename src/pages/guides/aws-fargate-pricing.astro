  <p>
    Fargate pricing is easiest to model as <strong>capacity × time</strong>: you pay for vCPU-hours and memory GB-hours
    for your running tasks. The hard part is estimating the <em>average</em> running tasks over the month and not
    forgetting the non-compute line items that show up on the bill.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model (minimum viable cost model)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Compute</strong>: vCPU-hours + memory GB-hours for running tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancer</strong>: ALB/NLB hourly + LCU/NLCU if you front services with a managed load balancer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion + retention baseline (and query scan costs if applicable).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data transfer</strong>: internet egress, cross-AZ, cross-region, and NAT gateway processed traffic.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate compute cost</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Estimate average running tasks over the month.</li>
    <li>Pick vCPU and memory per task (or use current task definitions).</li>
    <li>Multiply by hours/month (often ~730 for always-on services).</li>
    <li>Apply your region pricing for $/vCPU-hour and $/GB-hour.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common cost pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Using peak tasks</strong> instead of average tasks (over-budgets the compute line item).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ignoring networking</strong> (NAT + egress + cross-AZ) for services that call external APIs or pull images
      frequently.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Verbose logging</strong> that turns into large ingestion + retention costs.
    </li>
  </ul>
