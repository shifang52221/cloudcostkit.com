  <p>
    Most endpoint cost models require two inputs: <strong>endpoint-hours</strong> and <strong>GB processed</strong>. This
    guide shows quick ways to estimate both without perfect data.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Estimate endpoint-hours</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count how many distinct interface endpoints you plan to deploy.</li>
    <li>Count how many AZs each endpoint will attach to (commonly 2 or 3).</li>
    <li>Use 730 hours/month for always-on infrastructure (or adjust for partial months).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Endpoint-hours = endpoints x AZs per endpoint x hours/month.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Estimate GB processed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      From NAT: identify which NAT traffic is actually AWS-service traffic that can move to endpoints (S3, ECR, STS, etc).
    </li>
    <li>From flow logs: roll up bytes for the relevant destinations and convert to GB/month.</li>
    <li>From scenarios: start with 30% / 60% / 90% of NAT GB processed as a sensitivity model.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Turn inputs into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-vpc-interface-endpoint-cost-calculator/">VPC Interface Endpoint Cost Calculator</a> for
    endpoint-hours + per-GB processing, and compare against{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/aws-nat-gateway-cost-calculator/">NAT Gateway cost</a>.
