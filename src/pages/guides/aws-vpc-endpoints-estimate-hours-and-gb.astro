  <p>
    Most endpoint cost models require two inputs: <strong>endpoint-hours</strong> and <strong>GB processed</strong>. This
    guide shows quick ways to estimate both without perfect data.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Estimate endpoint-hours</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count how many distinct interface endpoints you plan to deploy.</li>
    <li>Count how many AZs each endpoint will attach to (commonly 2 or 3).</li>
    <li>Use 730 hours/month for always-on infrastructure (or adjust for partial months).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Endpoint-hours = endpoints x AZs per endpoint x hours/month.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      For ephemeral environments, estimate active hours/month (for example: 8 hours/day * weekdays) rather than assuming a full month.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you plan to deploy endpoints per VPC per environment, include that multiplier explicitly (prod + staging + dev).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Estimate GB processed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      From NAT: identify which NAT traffic is actually AWS-service traffic that can move to endpoints (S3, ECR, STS, etc).
    </li>
    <li>From flow logs: roll up bytes for the relevant destinations and convert to GB/month.</li>
    <li>From scenarios: start with 30% / 60% / 90% of NAT GB processed as a sensitivity model.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    The goal is not to be perfect on day one. Build scenarios and tighten the estimate once you have flow logs and a billing cycle.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked scenario example</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint-hours</strong>: 6 endpoints * 3 AZ * 730 hours/month = 13,140 endpoint-hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GB processed</strong>: 4 TB/month AWS-service traffic moving off NAT into endpoints (model low/medium/high)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Turn inputs into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-vpc-interface-endpoint-cost-calculator/">VPC Interface Endpoint Cost Calculator</a> for
    endpoint-hours + per-GB processing, and compare against{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/aws-nat-gateway-cost-calculator/">NAT Gateway cost</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Save a baseline scenario (NAT-heavy) and an endpoint scenario (endpoints + reduced NAT GB).</li>
    <li>Do not forget transfer: endpoint decisions can change cross-AZ paths and create transfer line items.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Counting endpoints but forgetting the AZ multiplier (interface endpoints are per AZ).</li>
    <li>Assuming 100% of NAT traffic moves to endpoints (many destinations remain public internet).</li>
    <li>Not separating one-time spikes (image pulls, migrations) from steady-state traffic.</li>
    <li>Missing cross-AZ effects when clients route to endpoints in other AZs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare endpoint-hours in billing to endpoints * AZs * hours. Large gaps usually mean inventory mistakes.</li>
    <li>Use flow logs to validate the GB processed order of magnitude and the top destinations.</li>
    <li>After rollout, reconcile NAT GB processed and endpoint GB processed as a before/after.</li>
  </ul>
