  <p>
    When people search for a "Kubernetes cost calculator", they usually want more than node hourly price. A useful
    estimate combines <strong>capacity planning</strong> (how many nodes you need) with <strong>line items</strong> that
    show up on the bill (load balancers, storage, egress, logs).
  </p>

  <h2>The cost checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Worker nodes</strong>: instance hourly price x node count x billable hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Control plane</strong>: some managed services charge a flat hourly fee.</li>
    <li><strong>Load balancers</strong>: per-LB hourly + data processed in some products.</li>
    <li><strong>Persistent storage</strong>: volumes, snapshots, and IOPS/throughput where applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Egress</strong>: NAT/Internet egress and cross-zone/region traffic.</li>
    <li><strong>Observability</strong>: logs, metrics, traces (often a surprise line item).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fast workflow (estimate in 10 minutes)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Convert per-pod requests into totals and node count with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-requests-limits-calculator/">Kubernetes Requests & Limits</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn node count into compute spend with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-node-cost-calculator/">Kubernetes Node Cost</a> (or{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/compute-instance-cost-calculator/">Compute Instance Cost</a> if you prefer).
    </li>
    <li>
      Add egress as a separate line item with <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data Egress Cost</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add logs/metrics as separate line items (start with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">Log ingestion</a> and{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/metrics-timeseries-cost-calculator/">Metrics series</a>).
    </li>
    <li>Finally, add load balancer + control plane + storage as fixed monthly line items for your cluster.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Allocatable vs capacity</strong>: you can't schedule 100% of a node. Leave headroom for daemonsets and
      system reservations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Autoscaling</strong>: use multiple scenarios (average vs peak) instead of a single node count.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hidden egress</strong>: NAT, cross-zone, and managed services traffic can show up as egress.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Observability costs</strong>: logs/metrics often scale with traffic and retention, not just pod count.
    </li>
  </ul>
