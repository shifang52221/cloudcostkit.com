  <p>
    CloudFront-style CDN bills usually have two primary parts: <strong>bandwidth</strong> and <strong>requests</strong>.
    This guide explains how to estimate both in a way that stays stable as pricing changes: you bring your own $/GB and
    $ per 10k (or per 1M) assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Estimate bandwidth (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use CDN analytics if you have them. If you only have throughput charts (Mbps), convert Mbps to GB/month using the{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a> or follow{" "}
    <a href="/guides/estimate-cdn-bandwidth-gb-per-month/">this bandwidth estimation guide</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have GB/month, price it with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN Bandwidth Cost Calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Estimate request volume (requests/month)</h2>
  <p>
    If you have request count from logs/analytics, use it directly. If you have RPS, convert it to monthly requests
    with <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to Monthly Requests</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then price it with <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN Request Cost Calculator</a>. If the
    pricing page uses per-1M units, convert your rate to per-10k (or vice versa) to match your calculator inputs.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Apply your pricing assumptions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bandwidth line item</strong>: GB/month x $/GB (use a blended rate if tiers apply).</li>
    <li><strong>Request line item</strong>: (requests/month / 10,000) x $ per 10k (or adjust to per 1M).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The benefit of this approach is that your model still works when prices shift; you update the two assumptions and
    keep the traffic math.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GB vs GiB</strong>: dashboards and pricing pages may use different units.</li>
    <li><strong>Tiered pricing</strong>: if you ignore tiers, your estimate can be off at higher volumes.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin egress/cache fill</strong>: low cache hit rates can push cost to the origin provider.</li>
  </ul>
