  <p>
    CloudFront log costs are usually not "CloudFront pricing" itself. They show up as storage, analytics, and SIEM
    ingestion. Estimate them like any other log pipeline: ingestion, retention, and scan/query.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Estimate log ingestion (GB/day)</h2>
  <p>
    Start from request volume and average bytes per log line if you do not have measured ingestion yet. If you already
    ship logs into a tool, use the measured GB/day.

  </p>

  <h2>2) Convert retention into GB-month</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Steady-state model: retention GB-month is approximately ingestion GB/day x retention days.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Add query/scan costs (the line item that can dominate)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How often you query (dashboards, incident response, scheduled jobs)</li>
    <li>How many GB you scan per query</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
