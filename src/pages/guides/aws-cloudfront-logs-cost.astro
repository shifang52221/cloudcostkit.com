  <p>
    CloudFront log costs rarely show up as a single “CloudFront fee”. They usually appear as <strong>S3 storage</strong>,
    <strong>analytics scans</strong>, and <strong>SIEM/log platform ingestion</strong>. Estimate them like any other log
    pipeline: ingestion, retention, and query/scan.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 0: know which log stream you enabled</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Standard access logs</strong>: delivered to an S3 bucket; your costs are mostly S3 + analytics on top.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Real-time logs</strong>: delivered to a real-time destination (often a stream); costs depend on the
      pipeline you choose.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you forward logs into another platform (CloudWatch Logs, Datadog, Splunk, etc.), include that platform’s ingestion
    and retention pricing as well.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Estimate log ingestion (GB/day)</h2>
  <p>
    A rough model starts from request volume: standard access logs are “about one record per request”. The missing
    variable is <strong>bytes per log line</strong>, which depends on fields and header lengths.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>requests/day × bytes/log ~= bytes/day</li>
    <li>bytes/day / 1e9 ~= GB/day</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">

  </p>

  <h2>2) Convert retention into GB-month (storage baseline)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Steady-state model: retained GB ~= ingestion GB/day × retention days.
  </p>
  <p>
    Guide: <a href="/guides/log-retention-storage-cost/">log retention storage cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Add query/scan costs (often dominates)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Frequency</strong>: dashboards, scheduled jobs, incident response searches
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scan size</strong>: GB scanned per query (filters and partitions change this dramatically)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Downstream joins</strong>: combining CDN logs with app logs and WAF logs increases scan volume
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Cost control levers (keep visibility)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Retention tiers</strong>: short retention for raw logs; longer retention for aggregated/security signals.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Partition well</strong>: store logs by date prefix so queries scan days, not months.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid repeated broad scans</strong>: use targeted queries and dashboards that don’t scan “all time”.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Route selectively</strong>: forward only high-value subsets (errors, specific paths, security events) into
      expensive tooling.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure actual log GB/day from the destination (S3, CloudWatch, SIEM) for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Confirm retention settings and lifecycle policies (including any replicated copies).</li>
    <li>Measure query scan GB for your real dashboards and incident playbooks.</li>
  </ul>
