  <p>
    Archive storage is optimized for <strong>rare reads</strong>. If you frequently restore, you may be better served by a
    warmer tier or by changing workflow patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce restores and rehydration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cache restored datasets for a short time instead of re-restoring repeatedly.</li>
    <li>For frequent analytics, consider a warmer storage class or a separate analysis copy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce small-object request volume</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Package small files into larger objects when it fits the access pattern.</li>
    <li>Batch retrieval and avoid per-file interactive restores.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Avoid minimum duration penalties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Be mindful of minimum storage duration rules when deleting/overwriting.</li>
    <li>Use lifecycle policies intentionally to avoid churn-driven early deletion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify changes</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-s3-glacier-cost-calculator/">S3 Glacier / Deep Archive Cost Calculator</a> to estimate
    savings from fewer restores or fewer retrieval requests.
