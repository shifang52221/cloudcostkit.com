    Route 53 savings are usually about reducing query volume and controlling zone sprawl. Query spikes often indicate
    misconfiguration or an incident that also impacts reliability.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Use sane TTLs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase TTLs for stable records to improve cache hit rate.</li>
    <li>Keep low TTL only for records that require fast changes (failover/blue-green).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce chatty DNS patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix retry loops and timeouts that trigger repeated lookups.</li>
    <li>Cache service discovery results where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Audit Kubernetes/CoreDNS behavior if you see very high lookup rates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce zone and record sprawl</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete unused hosted zones and old environment domains.</li>
    <li>Consolidate duplicate records across accounts where possible.</li>
    <li>Retire legacy records left behind by migrations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure queries/day for at least 7 days (avoid incident spikes).</li>
    <li>After TTL changes, confirm rollout/failover behavior still meets your needs.</li>
    <li>Re-check during incidents: repeated failures often create query spikes.</li>
  </ul>
