  <p>
    Route 53 savings are usually about <strong>reducing query volume</strong> and controlling <strong>zone sprawl</strong>.
    Query spikes often indicate misconfiguration or an incident that also impacts reliability.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Use sane TTLs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase TTLs for stable records to improve cache hit rate.</li>
    <li>Keep low TTL only for records that require fast changes (failover/blue-green).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce chatty DNS patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix retry loops and timeouts that trigger repeated lookups.</li>
    <li>Cache service discovery results where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Audit Kubernetes/CoreDNS behavior if you see very high lookup rates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce zone and record sprawl</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete unused hosted zones and old environment domains.</li>
    <li>Consolidate duplicate records across accounts where possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify impact</h2>

    query volume or fewer zones/health checks.
