  <p>
    Load balancers can become a major cost line item even when compute is stable. The typical drivers are “always-on”
    hourly charges and traffic-based components that scale with throughput or connection patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Number of load balancers and hours/month</li>
    <li>GB/month processed (in/out)</li>
    <li>Request rate, connection count, and TLS overhead (depending on provider billing model)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common cost patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One load balancer per service in Kubernetes (too many LBs)</li>
    <li>High-throughput APIs or large downloads</li>
    <li>Long-lived connections and chatty clients</li>
  </ul>
