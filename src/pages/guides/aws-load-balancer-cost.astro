  <p>
    Load balancers can become a major cost line item even when compute is stable. The typical drivers are always-on
    hourly charges and traffic-based components that scale with throughput or connection patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Number of load balancers and hours/month</li>
    <li>Capacity unit-hours (LCU for ALB, NLCU for NLB)</li>
    <li>Request rate, connection count, and TLS overhead (depending on provider billing model)</li>
  </ul>

    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-load-balancer-cost-calculator/">Load balancer cost calculator</a> to estimate fixed +
    usage components using your pricing inputs.
  </p>

  <h2>Common cost patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One load balancer per service in Kubernetes (too many LBs)</li>
    <li>High-throughput APIs or large downloads</li>
    <li>Long-lived connections and chatty clients</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
