    Logs Insights spend scales with scanned bytes. Most cost wins come from reducing how much data your queries scan and
    how often you run those queries.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce time ranges</h2>
  <p>
    Broad "last 7 days" queries are expensive. Default dashboards to shorter windows (15m/1h/6h) and use longer windows
    only when investigating.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Filter early and narrow scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Filter on service/env first before heavy parsing or aggregation.</li>
    <li>Avoid querying across all log groups by default.</li>
    <li>Prefer targeted queries for high-volume log groups.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Tune dashboards and automation</h2>
  <p>
    Dashboard refresh frequency can drive many repeated queries. Increase refresh intervals and batch queries where
    possible.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Reduce noisy logs at source</h2>
  <p>
    Less log volume means fewer bytes to scan. Remove verbose debug logs in steady state and set retention intentionally.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Validate with a calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-logs-insights-cost-calculator/">Logs Insights Cost Calculator</a> to see how reducing
    scanned GB/day changes monthly cost.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate scanned GB/day from query metrics for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Reduce time ranges and add filters early to prevent broad scans.</li>
    <li>Watch for recurring dashboards that run heavy queries frequently.</li>
  </ul>
