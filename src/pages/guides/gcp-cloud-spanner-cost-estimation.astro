  <p>
    Spanner-like databases are capacity-planned. Reliable cost estimation comes from separating four drivers:{" "}
    <strong>provisioned capacity</strong>, <strong>stored data + indexes</strong>, <strong>backups/retention</strong>, and{" "}
    <strong>multi-region/network patterns</strong>. Underestimates usually come from using averages and ignoring peak windows
    (and the slow path).
  </p>

  <h2>0) What to measure (the inputs that matter)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Capacity baseline + peak</strong>: capacity-hours per month (or equivalent) across normal and peak periods.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Average storage GB-month</strong>: data GB + index overhead, averaged across the month (not end-of-month size).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backups/retention</strong>: backup GB-month and retention windows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Traffic topology</strong>: which clients/services are cross-zone or cross-region.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Capacity: baseline vs peak (capacity-hours)</h2>
  <p>
    Model at least two scenarios: a baseline month and a peak month. If you scale capacity over time, estimate capacity-hours
    rather than using one static number.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Baseline: steady reads/writes plus background work.</li>
    <li>Peak: deployments, reprocessing/backfills, incident retry storms.</li>
    <li>Slow path: p95 queries and timeouts are often what forces headroom.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>2) Storage: data + index overhead (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Storage is predictable if you model growth and index overhead explicitly. The safest approximation is to treat indexes as
    a separate multiplier (even a rough percentage is better than ignoring it).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data GB: current size and monthly growth rate.</li>
    <li>Index overhead: estimate as a % of data if you do not have exact numbers.</li>
    <li>Average GB-month: use mid-month average for linear growth, not end-of-month size.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>3) Backups and retention</h2>
  <p>
    Backups are typically billed separately from primary storage. Long retention and compliance requirements can turn backups
    into a meaningful line item even when the primary dataset is stable.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep retention settings explicit (days/months).</li>
    <li>Plan for restore validation (you need a realistic drill, not just a checkbox).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Multi-region patterns: transfer and replication</h2>
  <p>
    Distributed topologies change the bill shape. If readers/writers are cross-region, model outbound transfer separately and
    avoid blending it into "capacity".
  </p>

    Tools: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">Cross-region transfer</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Separate inter-zone vs inter-region so you target the right optimization lever.</li>
    <li>If you front services with a CDN, avoid double-counting edge bandwidth and origin egress.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Capacity</strong> = baseline + peak (capacity-hours/month)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Primary storage</strong> = avg (data + index) GB-month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backups</strong> = backup GB-month (retention window)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Network transfer</strong> = outbound GB/month (split inter-zone vs inter-region)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sizing from averages and ignoring peak windows (deploys, backfills, incident retries).</li>
    <li>Ignoring inefficient queries and index patterns (the slow path drives headroom).</li>
    <li>Using end-of-month storage instead of average GB-month for growing datasets.</li>
    <li>Forgetting multi-region client traffic and cross-region replication patterns.</li>
    <li>Long backup retention silently growing month over month.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate (practical checklist)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak windows and incident behavior (retries and timeouts multiply operations).</li>
    <li>Validate query efficiency before you buy more capacity (slow queries, hot keys, missing indexes).</li>
    <li>Validate storage growth, retention policies, and index overhead.</li>
    <li>Validate cross-zone/cross-region traffic using flow logs or service metrics.</li>
  </ul>
