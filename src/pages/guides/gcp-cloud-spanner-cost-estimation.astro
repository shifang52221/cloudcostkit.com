  <p>
    Spanner-like systems are capacity-planned. Cost estimation is reliable when you separate: <strong>provisioned capacity</strong>,
    <strong>stored data</strong>, and <strong>distributed access patterns</strong>. Underestimates usually come from using
    averages and ignoring peak load windows.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Provisioned capacity (baseline + peak)</h2>
  <p>
    Model a baseline and a peak scenario. If you autoscale or change capacity over time, estimate average capacity-hours per
    month rather than a single static number.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>2) Storage and growth</h2>
  <p>
    Use average stored GB-month and model growth. If you keep history or large indexes, storage can grow faster than expected.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">Storage growth</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Distributed access and transfer</h2>
  <p>
    Multi-region deployments can introduce transfer and replication-related costs. If clients are cross-region, model outbound
    GB/month separately and validate boundaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak load windows and “incident behavior” (retries and timeouts multiply operations).</li>
    <li>Validate query efficiency and indexes (inefficient queries can force higher capacity).</li>
    <li>Validate storage growth, retention, and index overhead.</li>
  </ul>
