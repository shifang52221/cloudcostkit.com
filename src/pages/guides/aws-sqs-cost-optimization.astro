    SQS spend scales with request volume. Most cost wins come from reducing how many API calls you make per successful
    message.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Batch whenever possible</h2>
  <p>
    If your architecture supports it, batch sends/receives/deletes to reduce per-message request overhead.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Fix retries and poison message loops</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use backoff and jitter on retries.</li>
    <li>Detect poison messages early and route them to a DLQ.</li>
    <li>Improve timeouts so messages don't get reprocessed repeatedly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce unnecessary Receive traffic</h2>
  <p>
    Aggressive polling and short visibility settings can increase billable receive calls. Tune polling behavior and
    visibility timeouts to reduce excess receives.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Validate changes with a calculator</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use <a href="/calculators/aws-sqs-cost-calculator/">AWS SQS Cost Calculator</a> to model requests per message and
      see how cost changes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Validate with metrics: NumberOfMessagesSent/Received/Deleted, and a representative week of volume.
    </li>
  </ul>
