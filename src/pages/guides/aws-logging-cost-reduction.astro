  <p>
    Observability bills usually grow because <strong>volume</strong> and <strong>cardinality</strong> grow silently. The
    highest-leverage reductions come from removing low-value data <em>before</em> it’s ingested, while keeping the high
    value signals (errors, latency, key business events) reliable for debugging.
  </p>

  <h2>What to measure first (so you optimize the right thing)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Log ingestion</strong>: GB/day by source (service, endpoint, environment)</li>
    <li><strong>Retention</strong>: days kept per log group / category</li>
    <li><strong>Query/scan</strong>: how much you scan/search (this can be a separate bill)</li>
    <li><strong>Metrics series</strong>: time series count and top high-cardinality labels</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>High-impact levers (priority order)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Source-side filtering</strong>: drop noisy logs before shipping (debug/info for hot paths, health checks).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sampling</strong>: keep full fidelity for errors; sample high-volume success logs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retention strategy</strong>: short retention for noisy logs, longer for sparse high-value logs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Format hygiene</strong>: smaller structured logs (avoid huge JSON payloads, duplicate fields).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cardinality hygiene</strong>: stop exploding metric labels (userId, requestId, full URL, stack traces as labels).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>1) Reduce volume at the source (the “saves everywhere” fix)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn off debug logs by default; use timeboxed flags for temporary debugging.</li>
    <li>Drop low-value endpoints: health checks, static asset requests, frequent polling.</li>
    <li>Collapse repetitive logs: “request started” + “request finished” can be merged or sampled.</li>
    <li>Prefer counters and metrics for high-frequency events instead of logs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Sample without losing signal</h2>
  <p>Sampling is safe when you keep the important paths unsampled:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Never sample</strong>: errors, warnings, security events, deployment markers.</li>
    <li><strong>Sample</strong>: successful requests on hot endpoints, verbose debug/info logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep traces</strong>: consider tracing for deep investigations instead of logging full payloads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Retention tiers (keep what matters longer)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hot</strong>: short retention for high-volume logs you rarely query.</li>
    <li><strong>Warm</strong>: medium retention for operational investigations.</li>
    <li><strong>Archive</strong>: long retention only for compliance and sparse high-value events.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    A common mistake is uniform retention across everything; it turns low-value noise into a steady storage bill.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Fix the “incident multipliers”</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retry storms</strong>: retries multiply both traffic and logs; fix timeouts and backoff.</li>
    <li><strong>Deploy storms</strong>: temporary error spikes can create huge log bursts.</li>
    <li><strong>Bot/noise</strong>: abusive traffic creates large access log volume with little business value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Metrics cardinality hygiene (avoid the silent series explosion)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t label metrics with high-uniqueness fields (requestId, userId, full path, stack trace).</li>
    <li>Bucket values (status family, route template, tenant tier) instead of raw identifiers.</li>
    <li>Audit top label keys and explicitly ban the worst offenders.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validate in a “before/after week” report</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ingestion GB/day by top sources (did the intended source actually drop?)</li>
    <li>Scan/query volume (did you reduce searchable data without breaking investigations?)</li>
    <li>Error detection (do you still catch and diagnose incidents fast?)</li>
    <li>Metrics series count (did cardinality stabilize?)</li>
  </ul>
