  <p>
    Observability cost usually grows because volume and cardinality grow silently. The best reductions come from removing
    low-value data before it is ingested, and keeping high-value data longer.
  </p>

  <h2>High-impact levers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Source-side filtering</strong>: drop noisy logs before shipping.</li>
    <li><strong>Sampling</strong>: keep full fidelity for errors, sample debug/info.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention tiers</strong>: short retention for hot logs, longer retention for sparse high-value logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Label hygiene</strong>: avoid high-cardinality labels in metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify the impact</h2>
