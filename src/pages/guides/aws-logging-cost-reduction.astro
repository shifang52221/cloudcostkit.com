  <p>
    Observability cost usually grows because volume and cardinality grow silently. The best reductions come from removing
    low-value data before it is ingested, and keeping high-value data longer.
  </p>

  <h2>High-impact levers (in priority order)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Source-side filtering</strong>: drop noisy logs before shipping.</li>
    <li><strong>Sampling</strong>: keep full fidelity for errors, sample debug/info.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention tiers</strong>: short retention for hot logs, longer retention for sparse high-value logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Label hygiene</strong>: avoid high-cardinality labels in metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify the impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Start with ingestion: <a href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">log cost calculator</a> and{" "}
      <a href="/guides/estimate-log-ingestion-gb-per-day/">estimate ingestion GB/day</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add query/scan: <a href="/calculators/log-search-scan-cost-calculator/">log search/scan cost</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Metrics cardinality: <a href="/calculators/metrics-timeseries-cost-calculator/">metrics time series cost</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce volume at the source, then validate you still catch errors and key business events.</li>
    <li>Track a before/after week: ingestion GB/day, scan GB/day, and top noisy sources.</li>
    <li>Set hard limits for debug logging (timeboxed feature flags).</li>
  </ul>
