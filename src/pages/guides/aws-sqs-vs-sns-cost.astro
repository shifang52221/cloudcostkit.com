  <p>
    SQS vs SNS cost comparisons go wrong when you compare list prices without normalizing the workload. The winner is
    usually decided by <strong>how many deliveries happen</strong>, <strong>how many requests per message you create</strong>,
    and whether <strong>retries</strong> are controlled.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Messages per month</li>
    <li>Fan-out (subscribers per message) for SNS</li>
    <li>Requests per message (receive, delete, visibility timeouts) for SQS</li>
    <li>Retries and failure rate</li>
    <li>Payload size and any transfer fees</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use calculators for a baseline</h2>

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/aws-sns-cost-calculator/">SNS cost calculator</a>
  </div>

  <h2>When SNS costs spike</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>High fan-out: deliveries multiply fast.</li>
    <li>Retries/redelivery loops: failures multiply deliveries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When SQS costs spike</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Multiple receives per message due to timeouts and visibility settings.</li>
    <li>High retry counts and poison-message loops.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
