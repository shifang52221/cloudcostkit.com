  <p>
    SQS vs SNS cost comparisons go wrong when you compare list prices without normalizing the workload. The winner is
    usually decided by <strong>how many deliveries happen</strong>, <strong>how many requests per message you create</strong>,
    and whether <strong>retries</strong> are controlled.
  </p>

  <h2>Normalize the workload first (same flow, same assumptions)</h2>
  <p>
    Before you compare costs, write down one concrete message flow (producer -&gt; routing -&gt; consumers) and count how many
    operations happen per published message. Do this for a baseline and a peak scenario (deploys, incidents, backfills).
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Messages per month</li>
    <li>Fan-out (subscribers per message) for SNS</li>
    <li>Requests per message (receive, delete, visibility timeouts) for SQS</li>
    <li>Retries and failure rate</li>
    <li>Payload size and any transfer fees</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fast baseline (use calculators, then refine)</h2>

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/aws-sqs-cost-calculator/">SQS cost calculator</a>

  </div>
  <p class="muted">
    Keep the estimate honest by saving two scenarios: baseline traffic and peak traffic. Messaging cost spikes are usually driven by retries and fan-out, not by slow organic growth.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked comparison template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Published messages/month</strong> = producer volume (baseline + peak)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>SNS deliveries/month</strong> = published messages/month * subscribers per message * (1 + delivery retry factor)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>SQS requests/month</strong> = messages delivered to queues/month * requests per message (Send + Receive + Delete + extras)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When SNS costs spike</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>High fan-out: deliveries multiply fast.</li>
    <li>Retries/redelivery loops: failures multiply deliveries.</li>
    <li>Verbose delivery targets: multiple protocols/targets per message increase total delivery count.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When SQS costs spike</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Multiple receives per message due to timeouts and visibility settings.</li>
    <li>High retry counts and poison-message loops.</li>
    <li>Backfills and replays that keep re-queueing the same payloads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common decision pitfalls (cost and architecture)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing one-to-many fan-out (SNS) against one-to-one processing (SQS) without normalizing deliveries.</li>
    <li>Ignoring consumer behavior: visibility timeouts and retries often matter more than list price.</li>
    <li>Forgetting downstream costs: Lambda, logging, and data transfer can dominate the messaging line item.</li>
    <li>Using one "average" and missing peaks. Spikes drive real bills and real outages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the comparison</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pull one week of real publish/delivery metrics and scale to monthly as a sanity check.</li>
    <li>Confirm retry behavior: delivery retries (SNS) and receive retries (SQS) are modeled as explicit multipliers.</li>
    <li>Verify payload size assumptions with logs (bytes per message and batch size in consumers).</li>
  </ul>
