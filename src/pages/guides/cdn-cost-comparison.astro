    A reliable CDN cost comparison is not about a single $/GB number. You need a normalized input set that captures
    bandwidth, requests, regions, and cache fill. Use this guide as a comparison checklist.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Normalize your inputs (the comparison worksheet)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bandwidth (GB/month)</strong>: edge delivery to end users.</li>
    <li><strong>Requests (per month)</strong>: total billable requests (per 10k or per 1M units).</li>
    <li><strong>Region mix</strong>: percent of traffic by region or price tier.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin egress (cache fill)</strong>: GB pulled from your origin provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Peak month</strong>: an incident or launch month for stress-testing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Compare the three cost buckets</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Edge bandwidth</strong>: apply $/GB for each region mix and sum.</li>
    <li><strong>Request fees</strong>: convert request units (per 10k vs per 1M) to a common unit.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin egress</strong>: model separately because it is billed by your origin provider, not the CDN.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Adjust for tiering and discounts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tiered pricing</strong>: use a blended rate or compute each tier explicitly.</li>
    <li><strong>Commit discounts</strong>: apply committed-use discounts to both bandwidth and requests if applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Free tiers</strong>: subtract allowances before applying rates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: Validate with two scenarios</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Baseline</strong>: typical month with your normal cache hit rate.</li>
    <li><strong>Peak</strong>: launches, spikes, or incidents (higher requests and cache miss rate).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    A provider that looks cheaper at baseline can become more expensive at peak if request pricing or regional mix is
    unfavorable.
  </p>

  <h2>Common comparison mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing only $/GB and ignoring request fees.</li>
    <li>Using a single region rate for a global traffic mix.</li>
    <li>Ignoring origin egress and cache fill.</li>
    <li>Using peak rates for a baseline comparison (or vice versa).</li>
  </ul>
