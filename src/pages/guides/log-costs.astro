  <p>
    Most log platforms charge for <strong>ingestion</strong> (GB ingested), <strong>retention</strong> (stored GB-month),
    and sometimes <strong>scan/search</strong> (GB scanned by queries). If your bill surprised you, it's usually because
    volume, retention, or query behavior drifted upward.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Separate ingestion from storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ingestion</strong>: GB/day x price per GB x days/month.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention storage</strong>: (GB/day x retention days) x $/GB-month (steady state).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you want the intuition behind the storage model, read <a href="/guides/log-retention-storage-cost/">log retention storage cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Estimate your inputs (GB/day and retention)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you have a provider export, use it directly (best).
    </li>
    <li>
      If you don't, estimate GB/day from events/sec and bytes/event. Guide:{" "}
      <a href="/guides/estimate-log-ingestion-gb-per-day/">estimate log ingestion (GB/day)</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pick retention intentionally: hot troubleshooting window (7-14 days) plus longer cold/archive if required.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Include scan/search if your platform charges for it</h2>
  <p>
    Some products charge by <strong>GB scanned</strong>. Scan costs often spike during incidents or when dashboards run
    broad queries repeatedly. If you're on a per-scan model, estimate scanned GB/day and price it.

  </p>

  <h2>4) The knobs that usually matter most</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reduce volume</strong>: drop or sample high-volume debug logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Shorten retention</strong>: keep low-value logs for fewer days; tier hot vs cold.</li>
    <li><strong>Query smarter</strong>: narrow time ranges and filter early to reduce scanned GB.</li>
  </ul>
