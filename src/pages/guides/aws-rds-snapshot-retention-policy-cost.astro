  <p>
    Snapshot retention is a trade-off between recovery objectives and cost. Most cost blowups come from long retention
    combined with high churn, plus manual snapshots that never expire.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Define what you actually need (RPO/RTO → retention)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Operational recovery</strong>: typical restore windows (days to weeks).</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance retention</strong>: long-term retention if required (months to years).</li>
    <li><strong>RPO/RTO</strong>: how far back you must be able to restore, and how quickly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you can’t describe the use case for long-term retention (audit requirement, contract, policy), you probably don’t
    need it on every database.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Model cost with churn x retention</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If churn is meaningful, backup storage tends to scale with <strong>daily changed GB x retention days</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use a low and high churn scenario if you do not have strong measurements yet.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>3) Avoid the common retention traps (the “silent” costs)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Same retention everywhere (dev/staging backups that linger for months).</li>
    <li>Manual snapshots without a lifecycle policy.</li>
    <li>Frequent snapshots for fast-changing datasets without cost guardrails.</li>
    <li>Cross-region copies that are never cleaned up after a project ends.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Use two tiers: short operational + targeted long-term</h2>
  <p>
    Keep the short tier for day-to-day recovery. Add long-term retention only where required and keep it scoped (critical
    databases, monthly snapshots, etc.).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Example operational tier (prod): 7–14 days; (staging): 3–7 days; (dev): 1–3 days.
    </li>
    <li>
      Example long-term tier: monthly snapshots kept for 6–12 months, only for regulated or business-critical databases.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prefer explicit ownership: tag snapshots with owner/team and enforce lifecycle rules so “no owner” snapshots expire.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cost guardrails (prevent retention from drifting)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set a monthly review: list snapshots by age and owner and delete anything that violates policy.</li>
    <li>Alert on backup storage growth (GB-month) by account/environment so drift is visible within days, not quarters.</li>
    <li>
      Require a reason for exceptions (long retention) and tie it to an audit ticket or compliance requirement so it can be
      revisited.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist (don’t shorten retention blindly)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Test restore workflows (PITR / snapshot restore) for the retention window you propose.</li>
    <li>Use Cost Explorer to compare backup storage GB-month before/after the policy change.</li>
    <li>Audit manual snapshots monthly (or automate cleanup) so they can’t accumulate indefinitely.</li>
  </ul>
