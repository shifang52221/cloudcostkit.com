  <p>
    Snapshot retention is a trade-off between recovery objectives and cost. Most cost blowups come from long retention
    combined with high churn, plus manual snapshots that never expire.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Define what you actually need</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Operational recovery</strong>: typical restore windows (days to weeks).</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance retention</strong>: long-term retention if required (months to years).</li>
    <li><strong>RPO/RTO</strong>: how far back you must be able to restore, and how quickly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Model cost with churn x retention</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If churn is meaningful, backup storage tends to scale with <strong>daily changed GB x retention days</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use a low and high churn scenario if you do not have strong measurements yet.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Avoid the common retention traps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Same retention everywhere (dev/staging backups that linger for months).</li>
    <li>Manual snapshots without a lifecycle policy.</li>
    <li>Frequent snapshots for fast-changing datasets without cost guardrails.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Use two tiers: short operational + targeted long-term</h2>
  <p>
    Keep the short tier for day-to-day recovery. Add long-term retention only where required and keep it scoped (critical
    databases, monthly snapshots, etc.).
