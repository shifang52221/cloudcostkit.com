  <p>
    AWS WAF-style pricing is usually a combination of <strong>fixed monthly baselines</strong> (Web ACLs + rules) plus a{" "}
    <strong>request-based charge</strong> that scales with total evaluated requests.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model (baseline + variable)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Web ACL count</strong>: how many ACLs you maintain (often per environment/app)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rule count</strong>: custom rules + managed rule groups you enable (based on your pricing model)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong>: total evaluated requests (watch out for attack traffic)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Downstream</strong>: log delivery, storage, search/analytics, and SIEM ingestion
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    The two most common budgeting failures are (1) modeling only the baseline and missing request spikes and (2) paying a second bill for logs and analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>A fast estimate (baseline + spike)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-waf-cost-calculator/">AWS WAF Cost Calculator</a> for the baseline + request model, then
    add log/analysis and any security tooling.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Baseline scenario: typical month requests and current ACL/rule inventory.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spike scenario: attack/bot window where evaluated requests are much higher.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline</strong> = ACLs + rules (and any managed add-ons you actually use)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong> = evaluated requests (allowed + blocked), baseline + spike
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong> = (bytes per request) * requests/month + retention + query scans
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where to get inputs (evidence path)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Evaluated requests</strong>: from WAF metrics/logs for a representative week; keep a separate spike window.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ACL and rule inventory</strong>: list ACLs by environment and identify duplicated policies (sprawl is common).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Log volume</strong>: measure bytes per event and multiply by events/day; do not assume "logs are small".
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Underestimating request volume during incidents (bot traffic, attacks).</li>
    <li>Keeping many almost-identical ACLs and rules across environments.</li>
    <li>Streaming full logs everywhere without volume controls.</li>
    <li>Measuring allowed requests only and forgetting blocked traffic in evaluated volume.</li>
    <li>Using one average and missing peak hours (spikes drive the bill).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the pricing model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reconcile evaluated requests against the bill for the same window (baseline week + spike window).</li>
    <li>Confirm rule/ACL inventory matches what is deployed (copy/paste ACL sprawl is common).</li>
    <li>Verify logging controls: sampling, retention, and dashboard query windows.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
