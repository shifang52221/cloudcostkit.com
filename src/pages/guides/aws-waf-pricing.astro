  <p>
    AWS WAF-style pricing is usually a combination of <strong>fixed monthly baselines</strong> (Web ACLs + rules) plus a{" "}
    <strong>request-based charge</strong> that scales with total evaluated requests.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Web ACL count</strong>: how many ACLs you maintain (often per environment/app)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rule count</strong>: custom rules + managed rule groups you enable (based on your pricing model)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong>: total evaluated requests (watch out for attack traffic)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Downstream</strong>: log delivery, storage, search/analytics, and SIEM ingestion
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-waf-cost-calculator/">AWS WAF Cost Calculator</a> for the baseline + request model, then
    add log/analysis and any security tooling.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Underestimating request volume during incidents (bot traffic, attacks).</li>
    <li>Keeping many almost-identical ACLs and rules across environments.</li>
    <li>Streaming full logs everywhere without volume controls.</li>
  </ul>
