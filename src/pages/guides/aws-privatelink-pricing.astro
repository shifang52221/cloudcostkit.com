  },
  {
    q: "Why does PrivateLink cost vary so much between teams?",
    a: "Because the workload shape varies. Some teams use a few endpoints with modest traffic. Others deploy many endpoints across multiple AZs and push high GB/month, which multiplies both components.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is PrivateLink always cheaper than NAT?",
    a: "Not always, but it often wins when you have high NAT GB processed to AWS services that can be accessed privately. You need to compare both using your traffic mix.",

  <p>
    PrivateLink helps keep service traffic private. Cost modeling is straightforward if you separate: endpoint-hours,
    data processed, and any transfer boundaries in your design (cross-AZ/cross-region).
  </p>

  <h2>1) Model the consumer side (interface endpoints)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How many endpoints you deploy (per service).</li>
    <li>How many AZs you attach per endpoint.</li>
    <li>How much data (GB/month) flows through the endpoints.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Model provider-side implications (if you publish an endpoint service)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If you are the service provider, the key is to understand traffic scale and the downstream infrastructure required to
    serve it (load balancers, targets, logs, and monitoring).
  </p>

  <h2>3) Compare against NAT and internet egress</h2>
  <p>
    PrivateLink frequently competes with NAT or public endpoints. Use the same traffic assumptions and compare:
    endpoint-hours + per-GB processing vs NAT gateway-hours + NAT GB processed (plus any egress where applicable).
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
