  <p>
    PrivateLink helps keep service traffic private. Cost modeling is straightforward if you separate three things:
    <strong> endpoint-hours</strong>, <strong>data processed</strong>, and <strong>transfer boundaries</strong> in your
    design (cross-AZ / cross-region).
  </p>

  <h2>What you pay for (the inputs that matter)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Interface endpoint-hours</strong>: billed per endpoint per AZ per hour. If you attach one endpoint to 3 AZs,
      you pay 3x endpoint-hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data processed (GB)</strong>: billed per GB that traverses the interface endpoint (use measured traffic, not
      guesses).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer boundaries</strong>: PrivateLink does not remove all transfer costs. Cross-AZ/cross-region designs
      can add transfer line items that dominate the total.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A simple monthly model (fast and accurate enough for planning)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Endpoint-hours ≈ (sum of <strong>endpoint AZ attachments</strong>) × <strong>hours in month</strong> (use 730 as a
    planning default).
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Cost ≈ (endpoint-hours × $/endpoint-hour) + (processed GB × $/GB) + transfer charges (if any).
  </p>

  <h2>1) Model the consumer side (interface endpoints)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Count endpoints by <strong>service</strong> (S3, STS, ECR, your own services, etc). Cost scales with how many
      distinct endpoints you create.
    </li>
    <li>
      Count AZ attachments per endpoint. A “standard” 3-AZ VPC often means 3 billed endpoints even if the traffic is
      small.
    </li>
    <li>
      Estimate processed GB/month using evidence: <strong>VPC Flow Logs</strong>, load balancer bytes, or observed client
      throughput. Include a peak scenario.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Model provider-side implications (if you publish an endpoint service)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If you are the provider, PrivateLink itself is usually not the bill — your bill is the infrastructure that serves
    the traffic (load balancers, targets, logging, and any transfer within your architecture).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you front the service with a load balancer, include its hourly + LCU/bytes pricing (and any cross-zone traffic
      you enable).
    </li>
    <li>
      If your service targets live in multiple AZs, confirm whether the traffic pattern causes cross-AZ data transfer.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you turn on high-volume logs (flow logs, LB logs), account for log ingestion + retention costs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Compare against NAT and internet egress</h2>
  <p>
    PrivateLink frequently competes with NAT or public endpoints. Use the same traffic assumptions and compare:
    endpoint-hours + per-GB processing vs NAT gateway-hours + NAT GB processed (plus any egress where applicable).
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tooling: <a href="/calculators/aws-vpc-interface-endpoint-cost-calculator/">VPC interface endpoint cost</a> and{" "}
    <a href="/guides/aws-nat-gateway-vs-vpc-endpoints-cost/">NAT vs VPC endpoints</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked example (sanity check your estimate)</h2>
  <p>
    Suppose you create <strong>4 endpoints</strong> and attach each to <strong>3 AZs</strong>. That is{" "}
    <strong>12 endpoint-AZ attachments</strong>. For a 730-hour planning month, endpoint-hours ≈{" "}
    <strong>12 × 730 = 8,760</strong>. Then add processed GB/month and apply your region pricing.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls (where surprise bills come from)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating endpoints per VPC/account without noticing the multiplier across environments.</li>
    <li>Always using 3 AZs even when the workload can safely run in 2 AZs (availability vs cost trade-off).</li>
    <li>Underestimating processed GB because you only look at “app payload” and ignore retries, timeouts, and backfills.</li>
    <li>Assuming PrivateLink eliminates cross-AZ transfer; cross-AZ service design can still create transfer charges.</li>
    <li>Comparing against NAT without including NAT GB processed and NAT hourly.</li>
    <li>Turning on verbose logs (flow logs / LB logs) without budgeting ingestion + retention.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate in billing (fast, reliable)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In Cost Explorer, filter <strong>Service</strong> to Amazon VPC and group by <strong>Usage type</strong>. Search for
      usage types containing “endpoint”.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirm that billed endpoint-hours roughly match your expected (endpoint AZ attachments × hours). If the billed
      number is higher, you likely have more endpoints or more AZ attachments than you thought.
    </li>
    <li>
      For GB processed, cross-check with VPC Flow Logs (bytes) for the subnets that host the endpoint ENIs or with
      workload telemetry.
    </li>
  </ul>
