  <p>
    With gp3, you can often choose performance more explicitly. That is great for cost control, but it also means you can
    accidentally over-provision IOPS and throughput. The safest sizing workflow starts from measured utilization and
    validates performance under realistic load.
  </p>

  <h2>gp3 sizing cues</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IOPS</strong>: baseline random IOPS from workload metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Throughput</strong>: MB/s for sequential scans or backups.</li>
    <li><strong>Volume size</strong>: GB baseline plus growth buffer.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Step 1: measure your baseline</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>IOPS utilization (average and p95) during a representative week</li>
    <li>Throughput utilization (MB/s) during the same window</li>
    <li>Latency and tail latency during busy periods</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">If you only measure averages, you will under-size; if you size for worst spikes, you will overpay.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: choose targets (planning rules)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>IOPS target</strong>: start near p95 and add a small buffer for growth and burst.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Throughput target</strong>: start near p95 MB/s; throughput matters most for large sequential reads/writes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Capacity</strong>: size GB for data + growth, not to “buy performance”.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Workload patterns (why IOPS vs throughput matters)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Small random IO</strong>: IOPS bound (databases, metadata-heavy workloads).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Large sequential IO</strong>: throughput bound (backups, large file operations).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mixed workloads</strong>: size both and validate under real traffic.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Rule of thumb: throughput is IOPS times IO size</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Rough relationship: throughput (MB/s) ~= IOPS * IO size (MB). If your IO size is small, you can be IOPS-bound even if
    throughput looks low.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked example (planning)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Workload p95: 3,000 IOPS with ~16 KB IO size (~0.016 MB)</li>
    <li>Throughput ~= 3,000 * 0.016 ~= 48 MB/s</li>
    <li>If you move to 128 KB IO size (~0.125 MB), throughput at 3,000 IOPS would be ~375 MB/s</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    This is why workload behavior (random vs sequential, IO size) matters more than a single "IOPS" number.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Setting IOPS and throughput from a single peak event (over-provisioning).</li>
    <li>Ignoring snapshots and restore patterns that create temporary throughput bursts.</li>
    <li>Changing settings without a canary and without tracking latency regressions.</li>
    <li>Overlooking application bottlenecks (CPU, network) and blaming the volume.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate performance under a busy window (deploy or batch job) after changes.</li>
    <li>Track latency distribution (p50/p95/p99) for the workload, not just IOPS.</li>
    <li>Re-check after 1–2 weeks to ensure growth does not remove safety buffer.</li>
  </ul>
