    gp3 makes it easy to pay for performance you don’t use. Budgeting is simpler if you treat performance as a separate
    knob from storage.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Separate storage from performance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: GB-month baseline cost.</li>
    <li><strong>IOPS</strong>: provisioned IOPS-month cost (if billed).</li>
    <li><strong>Throughput</strong>: provisioned MB/s-month cost (if billed).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Budget with two scenarios</h2>
  <p>
    Create a “typical” scenario and a “peak” scenario. Peak periods (batch jobs, backups, migrations) can require higher
    throughput and IOPS.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Use a calculator to sanity-check</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-ebs-cost-calculator/">AWS EBS Cost Calculator</a> and set IOPS/throughput prices to $0
    if they don't apply to your chosen volume type.
