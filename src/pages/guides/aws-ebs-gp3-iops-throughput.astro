  {
    q: "Why do gp3 estimates go wrong?",
    a: "Because teams provision peak performance 24/7. Peaks are often rare (backups, batch jobs, migrations). Budget with separate scenarios and validate with real metrics.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I validate gp3 performance settings?",
    a: "Compare provisioned IOPS/throughput to actual utilization and latency. If utilization is consistently low, you can usually reduce provisioned values safely.",

    gp3 makes it easy to pay for performance you don't use. Budgeting is simpler if you treat performance as a separate
    knob from storage, and validate with measured IOPS/throughput once the workload runs.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Separate storage from performance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: GB-month baseline cost.</li>
    <li><strong>IOPS</strong>: provisioned IOPS-month cost (if billed).</li>
    <li><strong>Throughput</strong>: provisioned MB/s-month cost (if billed).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Budget with two scenarios</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Typical</strong>: steady-state throughput and IOPS.</li>
    <li><strong>Peak</strong>: batch jobs, backups, migrations, reindexing, or high-traffic events.</li>
    <li>Do not pay peak 24/7 unless the workload is truly always at peak.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Validate with metrics (the part that prevents waste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare actual IOPS and throughput against provisioned values.</li>
    <li>Track latency and queue depth for the workload's peak window.</li>
    <li>If utilization stays low, reduce provisioned performance and re-check latency.</li>
  </ul>
