  <p>
    Cloud NAT sits on the outbound path for private workloads. That makes its cost highly sensitive to deployment patterns
    and incident behavior. The estimate becomes reliable once you isolate the outbound flows routed through NAT and model
    baseline vs peak.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define the boundary (what uses NAT)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Which subnets</strong> route internet-bound traffic through Cloud NAT?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Which workloads</strong> live there (GKE nodes, VM fleets, build runners)?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Which destinations</strong> dominate bytes (registries, package repos, external APIs, telemetry)?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Outbound GB processed (the main driver)</h2>
  <p>
    List your major outbound flows and estimate monthly GB for each flow. This also reveals what to cache or proxy to
    reduce cost.

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Container pulls</strong>: scale-outs and node churn cause repeated downloads.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Package downloads</strong>: CI runners and autoscaling environments re-download dependencies unless cached.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>External APIs</strong>: response size × request volume, multiplied by retries.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Telemetry</strong>: metrics/log shipping is often constant background traffic.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Model the peak month (retries + churn)</h2>
  <p>
    The peak scenario is where Cloud NAT surprises teams. Model deploy windows and incidents separately.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Retries/timeouts</strong>: each retry repeats payload transfer; apply a multiplier during incident windows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cold caches</strong>: new nodes pull images and dependencies with no local cache.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dependency storms</strong>: upstream slowness increases duration and retries across the fleet.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Practical levers to reduce cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cache big outbound flows</strong>: registry mirrors, package proxies, artifact caching.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fix retries</strong>: backoff and timeouts reduce paid traffic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Move large downloads off the hot path</strong>: avoid pulling large artifacts at runtime.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reduce telemetry volume</strong>: sample high-volume logs and shorten retention for noisy sources.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline GB/month</strong> = sum of outbound flows routed via NAT
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak add-on GB</strong> = deploy + incident windows (image pulls + retries)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retry multiplier</strong> = 1 + retry_rate (apply to affected flows)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate routing: which subnets use NAT and which have direct egress paths.</li>
    <li>Validate top destinations by bytes in a representative week.</li>
    <li>Validate peak windows (deploys/incidents) where outbound GB spikes.</li>
    <li>After changes, confirm NAT traffic decreases (not just shifts to another paid leg).</li>
  </ul>
