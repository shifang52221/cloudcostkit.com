  <p>
    Cloud NAT sits on the outbound path for private workloads. That makes its cost highly sensitive to deployment patterns
    and incident behavior. The estimate is straightforward once you isolate the outbound flows routed through NAT.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Hours</h2>
  <p>Model NAT gateway hours per region/environment.</p>

  <h2>2) Outbound GB processed</h2>
  <p>
    List your major outbound flows (package downloads, container pulls, external APIs, telemetry) and estimate monthly GB for
    each. This also reveals what to cache or proxy to reduce cost.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Cost multipliers to watch</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Retries/timeouts that repeat large payloads.</li>
    <li>Scale-outs and node churn causing repeated image pulls.</li>
    <li>CI runners downloading dependencies repeatedly without caching.</li>
    <li>High-volume telemetry shipped out of VPC.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate routing: which subnets use NAT and which have direct egress paths.</li>
    <li>Validate peak windows (deploys/incidents) where outbound GB spikes.</li>
    <li>Validate caching: registries, package proxies, CDN for large downloads.</li>
  </ul>
