  <p>
    RDS vs Aurora comparisons go wrong when teams compare list prices without normalizing the workload. Use this checklist
    to compare apples-to-apples: compute hours, average storage, retention, and at least one peak scenario.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Normalize compute usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instances x hours/month (provisioned)</li>
    <li>Average capacity and peak capacity (serverless)</li>
    <li>Read replicas and HA (model as additional instances/capacity)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Normalize storage and growth</h2>
  <p>
    Storage growth is often the long-term cost driver. Forecast multiple months, not only today's size.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Normalize backups/retention (the common surprise)</h2>
  <p>
    Treat backup storage as a separate line item and apply churn x retention. Confirm whether non-prod environments are
    retaining history longer than needed.

  </p>

  <h2>4) Include workload-driven "high usage" scenarios</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Batch jobs and backfills</li>
    <li>Retry storms during incidents</li>
    <li>Large periodic index rebuilds / vacuum / maintenance windows</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Practical next step</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-rds-cost-calculator/">AWS RDS Cost Calculator</a> for a baseline compute + storage +
    backups model, then layer Aurora-specific scenarios on top.
