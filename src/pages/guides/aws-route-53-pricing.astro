  <p>
    Route 53-style costs are typically a combination of <strong>hosted zone fees</strong> plus <strong>DNS query charges</strong>
    and (optionally) <strong>health checks</strong>. The best cost model starts with measured query volume.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model (the 3 line items)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hosted zones</strong>: how many zones you maintain across environments/accounts
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Standard queries/month</strong>: your actual DNS query volume
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Health checks</strong>: if you use DNS-level health checks or endpoint monitoring
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to get the inputs (without guessing)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Zones</strong>: list public and private zones separately. In multi-account setups, zones often get duplicated across
      environments.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Queries</strong>: prefer a measured window from query logs. If you do not have logs, start from DNS QPS/RPS and convert
      to monthly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Health checks</strong>: count them, and confirm whether you have per-endpoint checks, multi-region checks, or checks per
      record.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate (2 scenarios, not 1)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-route-53-cost-calculator/">AWS Route 53 Cost Calculator</a> for a simple zones + queries + health checks model.
    Then refine query volume using metrics/logs from a representative time window.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline scenario</strong>: a typical week (exclude outage windows and launch days).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak scenario</strong>: incident retry storms, cache misses, or a short-lived traffic spike. This is what prevents a
      budget from failing in real life.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Query estimation methods</h2>
  <h3>Method A: From query logs (best)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable Route 53 query logging and sample at least 7 days.</li>
    <li>Compute: queries/day by hosted zone and top record names.</li>
    <li>Use the peak day as a sanity check for incident windows.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Method B: From request rate (good first pass)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Convert RPS/QPS to monthly queries using{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Apply a multiplier for retries and cache misses (use a separate peak scenario rather than one inflated average).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What usually causes surprise bills (and how to prevent them)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Very low TTLs</strong>: every resolver cache refresh becomes a paid query. Low TTLs have a purpose, but treat them as a
      cost decision.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Service scale-out</strong>: more pods/instances often means more DNS lookups (especially with chatty clients or short DNS
      caches in runtimes).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retry storms</strong>: outages can multiply DNS queries as clients retry or fail over. Keep a peak scenario in your model.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Health check sprawl</strong>: checks per endpoint and per environment add steady monthly cost and can be missed in budgets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CNAME chains</strong>: not always a cost problem, but they can increase lookup behavior and worsen incident sensitivity.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hosted zones cost</strong> = public zones + private zones (as applicable)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Query cost</strong> = standard queries/month (baseline) + standard queries/month (peak scenario)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Health checks cost</strong> = health checks/month (baseline) + any extra checks used only for peak events
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In Cost Explorer / CUR, confirm you see distinct line items for hosted zones, queries, and health checks.</li>
    <li>Compare baseline vs peak: if peak is not materially higher, you may be missing incident behavior in your model.</li>
    <li>Audit the top record names from query logs and look for noisy internal service discovery patterns.</li>
  </ul>
