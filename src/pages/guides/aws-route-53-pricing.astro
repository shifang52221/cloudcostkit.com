  <p>
    Route 53-style costs are typically a combination of <strong>hosted zone fees</strong> plus <strong>DNS query charges</strong>
    and (optionally) <strong>health checks</strong>. The best cost model starts with measured query volume.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hosted zones</strong>: how many zones you maintain across environments/accounts
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Standard queries/month</strong>: your actual DNS query volume
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Health checks</strong>: if you use DNS-level health checks or endpoint monitoring
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-route-53-cost-calculator/">AWS Route 53 Cost Calculator</a> for a simple zones + queries + health checks model.
    Then refine query volume using metrics/logs from a representative time window.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate query volume from a representative window (avoid incident spikes).</li>
    <li>Check TTL strategy: extremely low TTL increases query volume and cost.</li>
    <li>Watch for retry storms and resolver misconfiguration during incidents.</li>
  </ul>
