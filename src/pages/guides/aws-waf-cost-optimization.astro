  <p>
    Most WAF savings come from reducing the <strong>volume</strong> and the <strong>blast radius</strong> of evaluated
    requests, and from avoiding rule/ACL sprawl across many apps and environments.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce evaluated requests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cache aggressively at the CDN for cacheable routes.</li>
    <li>Rate-limit abusive traffic early (before it fans out).</li>
    <li>Block obvious bot paths and noisy endpoints (login, search) with targeted rules.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Keep ACLs and rules tight</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Consolidate similar policies; avoid duplicating ACLs per microservice without need.</li>
    <li>Remove unused rules and overly broad managed rule sets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Control downstream logging/analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sample or filter logs for noisy paths if you don't need full fidelity.</li>
    <li>Set retention intentionally; avoid storing everything forever.</li>
    <li>Optimize queries to avoid repeated full scans.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify changes</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-waf-cost-calculator/">WAF Cost Calculator</a> to estimate savings from reducing rule
    count or request volume.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
