  <p>
    Aurora estimates go wrong when teams model only compute. A realistic model includes at least four lines: compute,
    storage, backups/retention, and a “high-usage” scenario for I/O-heavy or bursty workloads. This page is a practical
    checklist you can use for a budget, a migration plan, or a “why did our bill spike?” review.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Choose the compute model (provisioned vs serverless)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Provisioned</strong>: estimate monthly instance-hours (including writer + readers).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Serverless</strong>: estimate ACU-hours as a baseline plus a peak scenario.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you use serverless, treat capacity as time-series usage, not a single average. See{" "}
    <a href="/guides/aws-aurora-serverless-v2-pricing/">Aurora Serverless v2 pricing</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Add storage GB-month (and model growth)</h2>
  <p>
    Storage is usually a steady cost that grows over time. For a first pass, estimate an average GB-month for the month
    you care about. For planning, build a simple forecast:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Current size (GB)</li>
    <li>Growth per day/week (GB)</li>
    <li>Retention window (how far back you keep data, if applicable)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">

  </p>

  <h2>3) Model backups and retention separately</h2>
  <p>
    Backups can become a “quiet baseline” cost, especially with long retention and high churn (frequent updates and
    large write volumes). Treat backup storage as its own GB-month line item and validate how retention is configured.
  </p>

    <a href="/guides/aws-rds-backups-and-snapshots/">backups and snapshots checklist</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Add a high-usage scenario for workload-driven costs</h2>
  <p>
    Even when you can’t price every internal detail up front, a second scenario prevents under-budgeting. Use it when
    you expect one or more of the patterns below.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Batch jobs that rewrite large tables or run heavy analytical queries</li>
    <li>Hot partitions or skewed keys that cause bursts</li>
    <li>Retry storms from upstream timeouts (incidents multiply usage)</li>
    <li>Large backfills, migrations, or index rebuilds</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Don’t forget the “around the database” line items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Read scaling</strong>: reader instances (provisioned) or reader capacity (serverless) increases compute.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data transfer</strong>: cross-AZ traffic and internet egress can show up when apps aren’t co-located.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logging/metrics</strong>: verbose SQL/audit logs and high-cardinality metrics can be a separate bill.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">

    <a href="/guides/aws-logging-cost-reduction/">reduce logging costs</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Compute</strong> = (writer instances × hours) + (reader instances × hours) or ACU-hours scenarios
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong> = average GB-month (include forecast if storage is growing)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backups</strong> = backup GB-month (retention + churn)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-usage scenario</strong> = peak compute/capacity hours + any known usage multipliers
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you want a single “close enough” number, keep compute as the variable and treat storage/backups as stable baselines.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Modeling only “DB size” and ignoring retention (backup GB-month).</li>
    <li>Using one average for serverless and missing frequent short peaks.</li>
    <li>Assuming storage won’t grow (or forgetting growth from indexes and history tables).</li>
    <li>Ignoring incident windows where retries multiply query volume.</li>
    <li>Missing the “surrounding” bills: load balancers, NAT/egress, logs, and metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In Cost Explorer / CUR, group by usage type and confirm your compute, storage, and backup lines exist as separate
      drivers.
    </li>
    <li>Compare your “high-usage” scenario to real peak windows (deploys, batch jobs, incidents).</li>
    <li>
      If you’re migrating, run a short parallel period and compare the shape of usage (steady baseline vs peaks), not
      only a single month total.
    </li>
  </ul>
