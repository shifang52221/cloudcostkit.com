    Aurora cost estimates often go wrong when teams model only compute. A complete model includes storage and retention,
    and often benefits from a second "high-usage" scenario for I/O-heavy workloads.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Model compute (instance-hours or ACUs)</h2>
  <p>
    Start from how many instances you run and for how many hours per month. If you use serverless, model your average
    capacity and add a peak scenario.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Model database storage (GB-month) and growth</h2>
  <p>
    Use your expected average storage (GB-month). If storage grows over time, build a multi-month forecast using{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">DB storage growth</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Model backups and retention as a separate line item</h2>
  <p>
    Backup storage can become a steady monthly cost with long retention and high churn. Treat it as separate from
    primary storage.

  </p>

  <h2>4) Add a high-usage scenario for workload-driven costs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Batch jobs that rewrite large tables</li>
    <li>Hot partitions / high write amplification</li>
    <li>Workloads with frequent retries and timeouts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Even if you cannot price every detail up front, a "high-usage" scenario prevents under-budgeting.
