  <p>
    CloudWatch Logs is best modeled as three buckets: <strong>ingestion</strong>, <strong>retention</strong>, and{" "}
    <strong>queries</strong>. Many teams budget only ingestion and forget that retention policies and query scans can be
    meaningful at scale.
  </p>

  <h2>Logs pricing inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ingestion GB/day</strong>: primary driver of spend.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention days</strong>: storage GB-month baseline.</li>
    <li><strong>Insights scans</strong>: GB scanned by queries.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>1) Ingestion (GB): what you write</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Measured GB/day</strong> is best (from your logging destination).
    </li>
    <li>
      If estimating: requests/day × bytes/log / 1e9 ~= GB/day.
    </li>
    <li>
      The biggest lever is <strong>log verbosity</strong>: fields, headers, and repeated payload fragments.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>2) Retention (GB-month): what you keep</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    First-order retention model: retained GB ~= ingestion GB/day × retention days.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Short retention for high-volume success logs.</li>
    <li>Longer retention for security and audit signals where required.</li>
    <li>Include copies: exports, replication, and forwarding to other tools.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>3) Queries and scans (often the surprise)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs Insights</strong>: usually priced by scanned GB.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Downstream analytics</strong>: exported logs queried in Athena/BigQuery/etc are usually priced by scanned data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dashboards</strong>: scheduled and auto-refresh queries drive steady recurring scans.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="btn-row">
    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/cloudwatch-logs-insights-cost-calculator/">Logs Insights cost</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/log-search-scan-cost-calculator/">Scan cost</a>
  </div>

  <h2>Log group strategy (reduces both retention and scan cost)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Split by intent</strong>: separate debug logs from audit/security logs from application error logs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retention tiers</strong>: short retention for high-volume success logs; longer retention where required.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Environment isolation</strong>: keep staging/test logs out of production queries and pipelines.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    This reduces “accidental scanning”: when a query meant for prod errors scans all environments and all verbosity levels.
  </p>

  <h2>Unit and pipeline pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>GB vs GiB</strong>: keep your unit consistent across ingestion estimates and pricing inputs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Copies</strong>: exports to S3, replication, and forwarding to SIEMs can duplicate storage and scanning costs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retry storms</strong>: incidents increase both ingestion (more events) and scans (more investigations).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Logging too much data “just in case” and never using it.</li>
    <li>Keeping high-volume logs forever without a compliance reason.</li>
    <li>Running dashboards that scan long time ranges repeatedly.</li>
    <li>Forwarding everything into a SIEM/log platform where ingestion is more expensive.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure ingestion GB/day for at least 7 days (weekday/weekend patterns).</li>
    <li>Confirm retention policies per log group and lifecycle policies for exported copies.</li>
    <li>Measure scanned GB/day for common dashboards and incident playbooks.</li>
    <li>Confirm which environments are included (prod vs staging) in pipelines and queries.</li>
  </ul>
