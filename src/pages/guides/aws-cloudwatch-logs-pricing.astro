  <p>
    CloudWatch Logs-style pricing commonly has two major components: <strong>ingestion</strong> (GB ingested) and
    <strong>retention/storage</strong> (GB-month). Retention is the lever that most often drives long-term cost.
  </p>

  <h2>Model the two line items separately</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ingestion: GB/day x $/GB x days/month</li>
    <li>Retention: (GB/day x retention days) x $/GB-month</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Calculator: <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-log-cost-calculator/">CloudWatch Logs cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Fastest ways to reduce log cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Drop noisy logs at source (debug/info floods)</li>
    <li>Shorten retention for low-value logs</li>
    <li>Split tiers: hot short retention + cheaper archive if needed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Logs Insights scan costs</h2>
  <p>
    If you use Logs Insights heavily, query scan charges can become a separate line item. Model scan cost from scanned
    GB/day using <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-logs-insights-cost-calculator/">Logs Insights Cost Calculator</a> and
    reduce scan volume with{" "}

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
