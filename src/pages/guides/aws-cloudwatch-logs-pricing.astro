  <p>
    CloudWatch Logs-style pricing commonly has two major components: <strong>ingestion</strong> (GB ingested) and
    <strong>retention/storage</strong> (GB-month). Retention is the lever that most often drives long-term cost.
  </p>

  <h2>Model the two line items separately</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ingestion: GB/day × $/GB × days/month</li>
    <li>Retention: (GB/day × retention days) × $/GB-month</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Fastest ways to reduce log cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Drop noisy logs at source (debug/info floods)</li>
    <li>Shorten retention for low-value logs</li>
    <li>Split tiers: hot short retention + cheaper archive if needed</li>
  </ul>
