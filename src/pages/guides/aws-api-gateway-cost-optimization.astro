  <p>
    API Gateway bills scale with <strong>requests</strong> and often <strong>bytes transferred</strong>. Most savings
    come from cutting one (or both) of those drivers, and from preventing retry storms.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce request volume</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cache hot reads (edge caching or application caching).</li>
    <li>Batch small calls and avoid chatty client patterns.</li>
    <li>Avoid aggressive polling; use events/streams when possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce response size</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable compression where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Paginate list endpoints; avoid huge default payloads.</li>
    <li>Move large downloads behind object storage/CDN instead of returning big payloads via the API.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Prevent retry-driven spikes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instrument timeouts, 5xx rates, and client retry counts.</li>
    <li>Fix slow upstream dependencies that trigger retries (databases, Lambda cold starts).</li>
    <li>Use backoff and circuit breakers to avoid thundering-herd patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validate with a cost model</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-api-gateway-cost-calculator/">API Gateway cost calculator</a> to quantify savings from
    reduced requests or smaller payload sizes.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate requests/month from logs or analytics; do not rely on a single peak RPS snapshot.</li>
    <li>Validate payload sizes (response KB/MB) because transfer can dominate for large payload APIs.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts can multiply requests and transfer.</li>
  </ul>
