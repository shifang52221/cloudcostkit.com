    Lambda costs usually scale with usage, but a few changes can dramatically reduce spend without changing product
    behavior.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce duration first</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use connection reuse for HTTP clients and databases.</li>
    <li>Move expensive initialization outside the handler when safe.</li>
    <li>Cache heavy lookups when correctness allows.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Right-size memory (and measure)</h2>
  <p>
    Memory affects both CPU allocation and GB-seconds. Benchmark a few memory sizes; sometimes a higher memory setting
    reduces duration enough to reduce total cost.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Treat logging as a billable product feature</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Log fewer bytes (avoid huge JSON blobs and repeated fields).</li>
    <li>Lower log level in steady state; sample noisy endpoints.</li>
    <li>Set retention intentionally (often 7-30 days, not forever).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">log cost calculator</a> to estimate ingestion + retention impact.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Avoid transfer and NAT surprises</h2>
  <p>
    If your function runs in a VPC, outbound traffic patterns can create extra line items (for example, NAT gateway).
    Model transfer early using <a href="/guides/aws-nat-gateway-cost/">NAT gateway cost</a> and{" "}
    <a href="/guides/aws-vpc-data-transfer/">VPC data transfer</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Always validate with a per-1M requests number</h2>
  <p>
    Convert your estimate into a unit cost to compare architectures and spot regressions quickly:{" "}
