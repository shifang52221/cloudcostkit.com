    Transfer costs are often the hardest part of a cloud bill to predict because they scale with usage and
    architecture. Use this guide as a framework to separate the transfer types and avoid double counting.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Split transfer into clear buckets</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internet egress</strong>: data leaving your provider to end users.</li>
    <li><strong>CDN bandwidth</strong>: delivery from CDN edge to users.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin egress (cache fill)</strong>: origin-to-CDN bytes.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-AZ</strong>: east-west traffic across zones.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-region</strong>: replication, multi-region reads, DR.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Estimate GB/month (fast methods)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>From metrics</strong>: bytes sent / transfer GB in billing exports is the most accurate starting point.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>From throughput</strong>: Mbps to GB/month using <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>From requests</strong>: requests/day x avg response size to GB/month using{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">API response transfer</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Price each bucket separately</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Internet egress: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">egress cost</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      CDN bandwidth: <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN bandwidth cost</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Cross-region: <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">cross-region transfer</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Validate (avoid double counting)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Separate <strong>CDN bandwidth</strong> from <strong>origin egress</strong>. Guide:{" "}
      <a href="/guides/origin-egress-vs-cdn-bandwidth/">origin egress vs CDN bandwidth</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Separate <strong>cross-AZ</strong> from <strong>internet egress</strong> (they are different boundaries).
    </li>
    <li>Check incident windows: retries/timeouts can multiply transfer.</li>
  </ul>
