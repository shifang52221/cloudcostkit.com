  <p>
    Commitments can reduce cost, but only if you have sufficient steady utilization. Break-even analysis helps you decide
    where commitments make sense and where on-demand flexibility is worth it.

  <h2>Break-even intuition</h2>
  <p>
    Compare the effective hourly cost of a commitment to on-demand. The break-even point is the utilization where the
    committed option becomes cheaper.
