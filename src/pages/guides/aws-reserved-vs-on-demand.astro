  {
    q: "Why do commitments underperform in real life?",

    q: "How do I reduce risk when committing?",
    a: "Start with partial coverage, prefer shorter terms when uncertainty is high, and review utilization monthly. Model a downside scenario (lower utilization) and confirm you still win.",

    q: "Reserved Instances vs Savings Plans — which is better?",

  <p>
    Commitments can reduce cost, but only if you have sufficient steady utilization. Break-even analysis helps you decide
    where commitments make sense and where on-demand flexibility is worth it.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Define what you are committing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scope</strong>: one service vs multiple, one region vs many.</li>
    <li><strong>Term</strong>: longer terms usually discount more but increase risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment</strong>: upfront vs partial vs no upfront changes cash flow (and effective rate).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    A commitment decision is mostly a <strong>risk decision</strong> (stability) disguised as a pricing decision.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: Break-even intuition</h2>
  <p>
    Compare the effective hourly cost of a commitment to on-demand. The break-even point is the utilization where the
    committed option becomes cheaper.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If commitment hourly is <strong>60%</strong> of on-demand hourly, break-even utilization is roughly{" "}
      <strong>60%</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>Below break-even, unused committed capacity becomes waste.</li>
    <li>Above break-even, you win by replacing on-demand with committed coverage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Quick formula: <strong>break-even utilization ≈ committed effective rate ÷ on-demand rate</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: Model uncertainty (this is where most estimates fail)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Utilization drops</strong>: rightsizing and autoscaling reduce baseline.</li>
    <li><strong>Workload churn</strong>: new products shift usage to different shapes.</li>
    <li><strong>Family/size changes</strong>: you may migrate to different instance families over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonality</strong>: peaks do not justify year-long commitments if troughs are low.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked example (spot the hidden risk)</h2>
  <p>
    If on-demand is <strong>$1.00/hour</strong> and your committed effective rate is <strong>$0.60/hour</strong>, the
    break-even point is ~60% utilization. If you expect 80% utilization, you likely win. If you expect 50% utilization
    after rightsizing and seasonality, you likely lose.
  </p>

  <h2>A practical workflow (how teams avoid commitment regret)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Measure baseline hours for 30–90 days (by region and instance family).</li>
    <li>Exclude workloads you plan to migrate or resize soon (uncertain usage shouldn’t be committed).</li>
    <li>Choose a conservative coverage target (for example, 30–60% of baseline), not 100%.</li>
    <li>Review monthly: if coverage is stable, increase gradually; if not, stop and re-evaluate.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="muted">
    The goal is not “maximum discount” — it’s <strong>stable realized savings</strong> without locking the team into the
    wrong shape.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a representative 30-90 day window to compute baseline utilization.</li>
    <li>Model a downside scenario (for example, -20% utilization) and confirm you still win.</li>
    <li>Commit gradually: start with partial coverage and expand after you see stability.</li>
  </ul>
