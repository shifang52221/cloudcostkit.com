    q: "Why do commitments underperform in real life?",

    q: "How do I reduce risk when committing?",
    a: "Start with partial coverage, prefer shorter terms when uncertainty is high, and review utilization monthly. Model a downside scenario (lower utilization) and confirm you still win.",

  <p>
    Commitments can reduce cost, but only if you have sufficient steady utilization. Break-even analysis helps you decide
    where commitments make sense and where on-demand flexibility is worth it.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Define what you are committing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scope</strong>: one service vs multiple, one region vs many.</li>
    <li><strong>Term</strong>: longer terms usually discount more but increase risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment</strong>: upfront vs partial vs no upfront changes cash flow (and effective rate).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Break-even intuition</h2>
  <p>
    Compare the effective hourly cost of a commitment to on-demand. The break-even point is the utilization where the
    committed option becomes cheaper.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If commitment hourly is <strong>60%</strong> of on-demand hourly, break-even utilization is roughly{" "}
      <strong>60%</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>Below break-even, unused committed capacity becomes waste.</li>
    <li>Above break-even, you win by replacing on-demand with committed coverage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Model uncertainty (this is where most estimates fail)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Utilization drops</strong>: rightsizing and autoscaling reduce baseline.</li>
    <li><strong>Workload churn</strong>: new products shift usage to different shapes.</li>
    <li><strong>Family/size changes</strong>: you may migrate to different instance families over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonality</strong>: peaks do not justify year-long commitments if troughs are low.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a representative 30-90 day window to compute baseline utilization.</li>
    <li>Model a downside scenario (for example, -20% utilization) and confirm you still win.</li>
    <li>Commit gradually: start with partial coverage and expand after you see stability.</li>
  </ul>
