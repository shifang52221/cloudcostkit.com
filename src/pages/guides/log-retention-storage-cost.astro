  <p>
    Log bills usually separate <strong>ingestion</strong> (GB ingested) from <strong>retention/storage</strong> (GB-month).
    Retention is the lever that quietly turns a stable ingestion rate into a growing long-term cost.
  </p>

  <h2>The steady-state model (the key idea)</h2>
  <p>
    If you retain logs for <strong>N days</strong> and ingest roughly <strong>GB/day</strong>, then once you've been
    logging longer than N days, the stored dataset is roughly:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stored GB ≈ GB/day x N</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Storage cost is then stored GB x $/GB-month (using your provider billing model).
  </p>

  <h2>Retention tiers (hot vs cold)</h2>
  <p>
    A common pattern is to keep a short "hot" window for interactive troubleshooting and a longer "cold" window for
    compliance or rare investigations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hot</strong>: 7-14 days at full fidelity (fast queries)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold</strong>: 30-180 days archived or stored cheaply (slower retrieval)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retention drift</strong>: default policies slowly expand across more log groups.</li>
    <li><strong>High-volume debug logs</strong>: long retention on verbose logs dominates storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixing units</strong>: GB vs GiB across dashboards and pricing tables.</li>
  </ul>
