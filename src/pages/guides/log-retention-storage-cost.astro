  <p>
    Log bills usually separate <strong>ingestion</strong> (GB ingested) from <strong>retention/storage</strong> (GB-month).
    Retention is the lever that quietly turns a stable ingestion rate into a growing long-term cost.
  </p>

  <h2>The steady-state model (the key idea)</h2>
  <p>
    If you retain logs for <strong>N days</strong> and ingest roughly <strong>GB/day</strong>, then once you've been
    logging longer than N days, the stored dataset is roughly:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stored GB ≈ GB/day x N</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Storage cost is then stored GB x $/GB-month (using your provider billing model).
  </p>

  <h2>Retention tiers (hot vs cold)</h2>
  <p>
    A common pattern is to keep a short "hot" window for interactive troubleshooting and a longer "cold" window for
    compliance or rare investigations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hot</strong>: 7-14 days at full fidelity (fast queries)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold</strong>: 30-180 days archived or stored cheaply (slower retrieval)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked example (sanity-check your model)</h2>
  <p>
    Suppose you ingest <strong>10 GB/day</strong> and retain logs for <strong>30 days</strong>. Once you reach steady state,
    stored logs are roughly <strong>300 GB</strong>. If storage is priced per GB-month, you can estimate monthly storage cost
    as 300 GB x ($/GB-month), then add ingestion and any query/scan costs separately.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you increase retention from 30 days to 90 days at the same ingest rate, stored GB roughly triples.</li>
    <li>If you reduce ingest (sampling, filtering, structured logs), retention cost falls linearly too.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Do not forget query/scan behavior</h2>
  <p>
    Storage is only one part of "retention cost". If your team frequently searches or scans logs (especially during
    incidents), scan/search can become a second spike. Keep scan volume and search frequency as explicit inputs.

  <h2>Fast levers (reduce cost without losing signal)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shorten retention for low-value debug logs; keep longer retention for sparse high-value security/audit logs.</li>
    <li>Sample noisy logs and reduce per-request log bytes (structured fields, fewer stack traces).</li>
    <li>Move cold retention to cheaper tiers/object storage if your provider supports it.</li>
    <li>Set defaults in IaC to prevent retention drift across new log groups/services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retention drift</strong>: default policies slowly expand across more log groups.</li>
    <li><strong>High-volume debug logs</strong>: long retention on verbose logs dominates storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixing units</strong>: GB vs GiB across dashboards and pricing tables.</li>
  </ul>
