  <p>
    For an audit-log cost model, you mainly need one number: <strong>events per month</strong>. The best estimates break
    it down by event type so you can see what actually drives cost.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: Count events from stored logs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count records/day from your CloudTrail delivery location.</li>
    <li>Separate by event type (management vs data) if possible.</li>
    <li>Use a representative time window (at least a week for spiky workloads).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: Estimate from automated activity</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>CI/CD, infrastructure automation, and autoscaling can generate many management events.</li>
    <li>High-volume data services can create far more data events than expected.</li>
    <li>Account for retries (they are real events).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn volume into a cost estimate</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-cloudtrail-cost-calculator/">AWS CloudTrail Cost Calculator</a> to translate monthly
    event volume into an estimate using your per-100k prices.
