  <p>
    A <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-cost-calculator/">Kubernetes cost calculator</a> often starts with node spend
    because compute is usually the biggest line item. But for many real clusters, <strong>everything around nodes</strong>{" "}
    adds up. This guide is a checklist for those missing costs so your budget is closer to reality.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Nodes (compute)</h2>
  <p>
    The baseline: size your node count from workload requests, then apply a blended $/hour. Tools:{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-requests-limits-calculator/">Requests &amp; Limits</a> and{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-node-cost-calculator/">Kubernetes Node Cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Managed control plane</h2>
  <p>
    Many managed Kubernetes products charge a fixed hourly control plane fee. It is small compared to a large cluster,
    but it can be meaningful for small clusters (especially dev/test).
  </p>

  <h2>3) Load balancers, gateways, and ingress</h2>
  <p>
    External load balancers, L7 gateways, and their data processing charges can dominate certain workloads. Even if the
    nodes are stable, traffic patterns can make this line item spiky.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your traffic exits the cloud or crosses regions, model egress separately with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data Egress Cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Persistent storage</h2>
  <p>
    Persistent volumes (block storage), snapshots, and object storage buckets all have their own pricing models. For
    S3-like object storage, use <a href="/calculators/storage-pricing-calculator/">Storage Pricing Calculator</a>. For
    growth over time, use <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">DB Storage Growth</a> as a
    simple estimator.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Logs and metrics</h2>
  <p>
    Observability is a common "surprise" cost. Logs are often billed by ingestion volume, and metrics are often billed
    by active series. Tools:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">Log ingestion cost</a></li>
    <li><a href="/calculators/metrics-timeseries-cost-calculator/">Metrics time series cost</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Data egress</h2>
  <p>
    Outbound traffic is not only "internet egress". It can include cross-region replication, cross-zone transfer, and
    service-to-service data movement depending on your architecture. Model it explicitly using{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data Egress Cost</a> and{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">Cross-region Transfer</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Suggested workflow (fast but accurate enough)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Estimate node count from requests (baseline capacity).</li>
    <li>Apply blended $/hour and uptime assumptions (average, not peak).</li>
    <li>Add control plane fee.</li>
    <li>Add storage (PV + object storage) and expected growth.</li>
    <li>Add observability (logs + metrics).</li>
    <li>Add egress and cross-region transfer if applicable.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Compare managed Kubernetes services</h2>
  <p>
    If you're deciding between providers, compare the same line items and swap assumptions:
    <a href="/guides/eks-vs-gke-vs-aks-cost/"> EKS vs GKE vs AKS cost comparison</a>.
