  <p>
    When people search for <em>CDN cost</em>, they focus on bandwidth ($/GB). But for many workloads,{" "}
    <strong>request fees</strong> can be a real part of the bill (especially API-like traffic with small payloads).
  </p>

  <h2>What is a "billable request"?</h2>
  <p>
    Each CDN defines billable requests slightly differently. In general, it maps to HTTP/HTTPS requests handled at the
    edge. Some providers separate request classes (for example, cache hits vs misses, dynamic vs static, or different
    protocols).
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Use your provider definition as the source of truth. The goal of the model is planning accuracy, not guessing how a
    specific vendor counts.
  </p>

  <h2>How to estimate requests/month</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      If you have CDN analytics, take the 30-day request count and use it as requests/month.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have RPS, convert it with <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to Monthly Requests</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you only have log samples, extrapolate carefully and validate once you have real metrics.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How to apply per-10k / per-1M pricing</h2>
  <p>Two common formats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Per 10k requests</strong>: request fees = (requests/month / 10,000) x $ per 10k</li>
    <li><strong>Per 1M requests</strong>: request fees = (requests/month / 1,000,000) x $ per 1M</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If your calculator expects per-10k and you have a per-1M price, divide by 100 (and multiply by 100 to go the other
    direction).
  </p>

  <h2>When request fees matter most</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API traffic</strong>: many small responses and a high request rate.</li>
    <li><strong>Highly cacheable sites</strong>: bandwidth drops, but request volume stays.</li>
    <li><strong>Bot spikes</strong>: request volume can jump while bandwidth barely changes.</li>
  </ul>
