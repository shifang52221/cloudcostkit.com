  <p>
    When people search for "CDN cost", they focus on bandwidth ($/GB). But for many workloads, <strong>request fees</strong>{" "}
    are a real line item. The key is to model request fees as a separate bill component and keep units explicit.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define "billable request" for your CDN</h2>
  <p>
    Each CDN defines billable requests slightly differently (protocols, classes, regions). For planning, treat a billable
    request as "an HTTP/HTTPS request handled at the edge", and then adjust if your provider splits classes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Some providers price <strong>HTTPS</strong> differently from <strong>HTTP</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some providers have <strong>regional tiers</strong> or different request classes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cache hit rate changes <strong>origin</strong> traffic, but request fees are usually counted at the edge.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Estimate requests per month</h2>
  <p>
    Use the most direct source you have. If you already run a CDN, analytics is the best input.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>From CDN analytics</strong>: use the provider's 30-day request count (best).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>From RPS</strong>: convert request rate to requests/month, then model baseline + peak.

        Tool: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>From logs</strong>: sample access logs and extrapolate carefully, then replace with analytics once available.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="muted">
    Do not ignore bots, health checks, and retries. Those are often the "hidden request volume" that makes request fees
    dominate.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Apply per-10k vs per-1M pricing (keep units explicit)</h2>
  <p>Two common formats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Per 10k requests</strong>: request fees = (requests/month ÷ 10,000) × price per 10k
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Per 1M requests</strong>: request fees = (requests/month ÷ 1,000,000) × price per 1M
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have a price per 1M and your calculator expects per 10k, divide the price by 100 (and multiply by 100 to go the
    other direction).

  </p>

  <h2>3) When request fees matter most (traffic shapes)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>API traffic</strong>: high RPS, small payloads, lots of 200/304 responses.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Highly cacheable sites</strong>: bandwidth goes down, request count stays high.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bot spikes</strong>: request volume jumps while bandwidth barely changes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Many small assets</strong>: sites that serve many tiny objects per page view.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Practical levers to reduce request fees</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cache better</strong>: caching does not reduce edge request fees, but it can let you simplify APIs and reduce
      origin traffic and retries.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reduce background traffic</strong>: health checks, synthetic monitoring, and cron pings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bot mitigation</strong>: block or rate-limit obvious bot traffic (especially on expensive endpoints).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Batch and paginate</strong>: one request can replace many small ones for some API designs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked example (sanity check)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>100 RPS</strong> sustained is ~259M requests/month (100 × 86,400 × 30).
    </li>
    <li>
      At <strong>$0.75 per 1M</strong>, request fees are ~259 × 0.75 = <strong>$194/month</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a bot spike doubles RPS for 5 days, add that as a separate peak line item.
    </li>
  </ul>
