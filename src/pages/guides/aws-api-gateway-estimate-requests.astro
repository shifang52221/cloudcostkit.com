  <p>
    For request-priced services, the fastest path to a decent estimate is turning a request rate chart into a monthly
    request count.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: From average RPS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month = avg RPS x 60 x 60 x 24 x days</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Choose the avg RPS over a representative period (last 7/30/90 days).</li>
    <li>Segment by environment if you have separate endpoints (prod vs staging).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: From logs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sum request counts per day from access logs, then multiply/average to a month.</li>
    <li>Exclude synthetic checks if they are frequent and not user-driven.</li>
    <li>Include retries if they hit the API (they are real billable requests).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 3: From users x actions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimate daily active users x API calls per user per day.</li>
    <li>Use separate estimates for heavy endpoints (search, list, export).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next: turn volume into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-api-gateway-cost-calculator/">AWS API Gateway Cost Calculator</a> to translate requests
    and response size into a monthly request + transfer estimate.
