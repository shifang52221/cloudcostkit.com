    SNS costs scale mainly with deliveries. The best savings come from reducing unnecessary fan-out and preventing
    retries during failures.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce fan-out and unnecessary deliveries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use filter policies so subscribers receive only relevant messages.</li>
    <li>Split high-fan-out topics into narrower topics by event type.</li>
    <li>Avoid sending large payloads to many subscribers; use pointers to objects when appropriate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce retries and failures</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix slow/erroring HTTP endpoints that cause repeated delivery attempts.</li>
    <li>Use dead-letter queues and backoff patterns to avoid retry storms.</li>
    <li>Monitor delivery success rates and latency.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Control alert storms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Dedupe and rate-limit alerts at the source.</li>
    <li>Group alerts by incident window instead of per-event notifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate fan-out: average subscribers per publish after filter policies.</li>
    <li>Track retry rate and endpoint failures; address failures before scaling up.</li>
    <li>After changes, confirm consumers still receive required events.</li>
  </ul>
