  <p>
    CloudTrail costs are typically driven by <strong>event volume</strong> plus downstream storage and analysis. Most
    savings come from narrowing the highest-volume event streams (usually data events) and keeping downstream analysis
    efficient.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: measure before you optimize</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count events/day for at least 7 days and split management vs data vs insight.</li>
    <li>Identify the top event sources (which services and resources generate most volume).</li>
    <li>Model a "busy week" scenario for deploy spikes and incident retries.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: control data event scope (highest leverage)</h2>
  <p>
    Data events can be orders of magnitude higher than management events. Treat data event enablement as a scoped audit
    decision, not a default checkbox.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Be selective</strong>: enable data events only for resources that require audit visibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Start narrow</strong>: begin with a subset (critical buckets/prefixes/functions) and expand with measurement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use selectors intentionally</strong>: avoid "everything by default"; scope by resource and, where possible, by event type.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common high-volume sources to watch</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Object-level operations on high-throughput storage (reads/writes at scale).</li>
    <li>Function and automation-heavy workflows that invoke many API calls per request.</li>
    <li>Scheduled jobs and scanners that touch many resources on a cadence.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    The goal is not to disable audit coverage blindly, but to scope it to what you truly need and can afford to analyze.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: reduce automated churn and retries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fix retry storms</strong>: timeouts and transient failures multiply API calls and therefore audit events.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quiet noisy automation</strong>: chatty IaC loops, frequent reconciles, and scanning jobs can dominate management volume.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Separate environments</strong>: test/staging can generate production-like volume if not isolated.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: reduce downstream waste (often overlooked)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Retention tiers</strong>: keep raw logs short; retain aggregated/security signals longer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Partition and filter</strong>: store by date and prefix so investigations scan days, not months.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Route selectively</strong>: forward only what you need into expensive SIEM or log platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reduce scan size</strong>: avoid repeated broad queries; build targeted dashboards that do not scan "all time".
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>After selector changes, re-measure data event volume to confirm the expected drop.</li>
    <li>Compare downstream scan GB for your top dashboards/queries before vs after.</li>
    <li>Confirm you did not remove required audit coverage for regulated resources.</li>
  </ul>
