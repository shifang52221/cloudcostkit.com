  <p class="muted">
    CloudTrail costs are typically driven by event volume plus downstream storage and analysis. Most savings come from
    narrowing the highest-volume event streams and preventing expensive downstream analysis sprawl.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Control data event scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable data events only for the resources that truly need audit visibility.</li>
    <li>Start with a short measurement window to quantify volume before scaling up.</li>
    <li>Prefer targeted prefixes/buckets rather than enabling everything by default.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce automated churn</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix retry storms and timeouts that amplify API calls.</li>
    <li>Reduce noisy scheduled jobs and overly chatty automation where possible.</li>
    <li>Timebox experiments that generate large API call volume.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce downstream waste</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set retention intentionally; avoid keeping everything forever by default.</li>
    <li>Query efficiently and avoid repeated broad scans.</li>
    <li>Filter/route logs so expensive tooling ingests only what it needs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure events/day by type (management vs data) for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Measure downstream scan/query GB and identify the top query patterns.</li>
    <li>After changes, confirm reduced event volume and reduced downstream ingestion/query cost.</li>
  </ul>
