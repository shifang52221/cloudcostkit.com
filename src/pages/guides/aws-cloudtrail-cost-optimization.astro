  <p>
    CloudTrail costs are typically driven by <strong>event volume</strong> plus <strong>downstream</strong> storage and
    analysis. Most savings come from reducing or narrowing the highest-volume event streams and preventing analysis
    sprawl.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Control data event scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable data events only for the resources that truly need audit visibility.</li>
    <li>Start with a short measurement window to quantify volume before scaling up.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce automated churn</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix retry storms and timeouts that amplify API calls.</li>
    <li>Reduce noisy scheduled jobs and overly chatty automation where possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce downstream waste</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set retention intentionally; avoid keeping everything forever by default.</li>
    <li>Query efficiently and avoid repeated broad scans.</li>
    <li>Filter/route logs so expensive tooling ingests only what it needs.</li>
  </ul>
