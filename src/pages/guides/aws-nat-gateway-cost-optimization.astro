  <p>
    NAT Gateway optimization is unusually measurable: almost everything comes down to <strong>gateway-hours</strong> and{" "}
    <strong>GB processed</strong>. The best savings usually come from keeping AWS-service traffic private and eliminating
    recurring downloads and retry storms that silently multiply outbound traffic.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 0: baseline the two drivers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gateway-hours: how many NAT gateways are always on (by environment and region)</li>
    <li>GB processed: average and peak (incident) weeks</li>
    <li>Top traffic sources: images, updates, external APIs, log shipping</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">

  </p>

  <h2>1) Keep traffic private (the biggest lever for many teams)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use VPC endpoints/private connectivity for common AWS services where available.
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid routing AWS API calls through NAT by accident (it looks like “internet egress” in the NAT bill).
    </li>
    <li>
      Validate that route tables and DNS resolution actually keep the traffic on the private path.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>2) Reduce large recurring downloads (often the hidden baseline)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Cache OS/package updates where practical (or use internal mirrors).
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduce container image size and avoid re-pulling unchanged layers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prevent “download storms” during autoscaling by pre-pulling or staggering updates.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Fix retry storms and noisy egress</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set sane timeouts and jittered backoff for outbound calls.</li>
    <li>Identify the top external destinations (APIs/SaaS) and validate volume against business expectations.</li>
    <li>Watch “polling” and keepalive patterns that create constant egress even at low traffic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Reduce non-prod waste</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Schedule dev/test workloads so NAT isn’t needed 730 hours/month.</li>
    <li>Don’t mirror production traffic volumes into staging unless required.</li>
    <li>Use smaller test datasets to reduce background job egress.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Endpoint-first checklist (common NAT drivers)</h2>
  <p>
    A fast way to reduce NAT processed GB is to identify which traffic is going to AWS services and keep it on a private
    path. Common NAT drivers to check (availability varies by region/service):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Object storage access</strong> (often large and steady)</li>
    <li><strong>Container registry pulls</strong> (large bursts during deploys/autoscaling)</li>
    <li><strong>Security token / identity calls</strong> (small per call, but can be high frequency)</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring/logging APIs</strong> (can be noisy in large fleets)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Practical flow: identify top NAT destinations, pick the top 1–2 AWS-service buckets, then validate the NAT GB drop
    after enabling private connectivity.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Validate savings (and ensure costs didn’t just move)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm GB processed dropped and identify which source changed.</li>
    <li>Check cross-AZ transfer and internet egress costs after routing changes.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows; if retries still spike, monthly savings will erode.</li>
  </ul>
