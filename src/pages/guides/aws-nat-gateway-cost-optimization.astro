    NAT Gateway spend is often “invisible” until it becomes a big line item. The good news is the cost drivers are
    straightforward: gateway-hours and GB processed.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Keep traffic private whenever possible</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use private connectivity/endpoints for common services where available.</li>
    <li>Avoid routing internal or in-region traffic through NAT.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce large recurring downloads</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cache OS/package updates.</li>
    <li>Cache or pre-pull container images; reduce image size.</li>
    <li>Avoid repeated downloads in auto-scaling events.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Fix retry storms and noisy egress</h2>
  <p>
    Retries multiply traffic. Timeouts and aggressive retries to external APIs can drive GB processed faster than you
    expect.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Validate with a calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-nat-gateway-cost-calculator/">NAT Gateway cost calculator</a> to see how reducing GB
    processed changes monthly cost.
