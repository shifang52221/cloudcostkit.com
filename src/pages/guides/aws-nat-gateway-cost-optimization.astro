    NAT Gateway spend is often invisible until it becomes a big line item. The good news is the cost drivers are
    straightforward: gateway-hours and GB processed.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Keep traffic private whenever possible</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use VPC endpoints / private connectivity for common services where available.</li>
    <li>Avoid routing internal or in-region traffic through NAT.</li>
    <li>Prefer private subnets with endpoints over "everything goes out through NAT".</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce large recurring downloads</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cache OS/package updates where practical.</li>
    <li>Cache or pre-pull container images; reduce image size.</li>
    <li>Avoid repeated downloads during autoscaling events.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Fix retry storms and noisy egress</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Retries multiply GB processed. Fix timeouts and aggressive retry policies.</li>
    <li>Identify top external destinations (APIs/SaaS) and validate their traffic volume.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure GB processed from NAT metrics or flow logs for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Identify the top 3 traffic sources (images, updates, external APIs, logging).</li>
    <li>After changes, confirm reduced GB processed and stable application behavior.</li>
  </ul>
