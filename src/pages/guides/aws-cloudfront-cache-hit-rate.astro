  <p>
    CDN pricing is usually focused on edge bandwidth and requests, but <strong>origin egress</strong> can become a major
    hidden line item. Cache hit rate is the key knob.
  </p>

  <h2>Simple model</h2>
  <p>
    Start with your expected edge bandwidth (GB/month). If your cache hit rate is H (for example, 0.85), then a simple
    approximation is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Origin egress (GB/month) = edge bandwidth (GB/month) x (1 - H)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is not perfect, but it is good enough for budgeting. Low TTLs, invalidations, and multi-region fills can raise
    origin egress beyond this baseline.
  </p>

  <h2>How to improve hit rate (and reduce origin egress)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use stable caching headers and longer TTLs for static assets.</li>
    <li>Avoid unnecessary cache-busting for large files.</li>
    <li>Reduce unique-object patterns (e.g., per-user URLs) where possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
