    The fastest way to estimate CDN bandwidth spend is a clean $/GB model, but you must normalize region mix and tiered
    pricing first. Use this guide to avoid under-estimating.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Get monthly GB delivered</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use CDN analytics if available.</li>
    <li>If you only have throughput, convert Mbps to GB/month before pricing.</li>
    <li>Model baseline and peak months separately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Apply region mix</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Split traffic by pricing regions (North America, Europe, APAC, etc.).</li>
    <li>Apply the correct $/GB per region and sum the totals.</li>
    <li>If you only have a blended rate, validate it against a real bill.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Account for tiered pricing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Some providers lower $/GB after specific volume tiers.</li>
    <li>Either compute each tier explicitly or use a blended rate for your expected volume.</li>
    <li>Do not use the lowest tier price for the entire month.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: Check free allowances and discounts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Subtract free bandwidth before applying $/GB rates.</li>
    <li>Apply committed-use or enterprise discounts if you have them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Effective $/GB formula (fast sanity check)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Effective $/GB</strong> = total bandwidth charges / total GB delivered.</li>
    <li>Use this to back-calc a blended rate from a real bill, then reuse it for planning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example calculation</h2>
  <p>
    If you delivered 8,000 GB with $420 of bandwidth charges, your effective rate is $420 / 8,000 = $0.0525 per GB.
    Use that blended rate for the next month unless your region mix or tier changes.
  </p>

  <h2>Validate with a peak scenario</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Peak months often shift region mix and cache hit rate.</li>
    <li>Use a higher GB/month and re-run the tiered pricing math.</li>
    <li>Compare effective $/GB for baseline vs peak so you do not under-budget.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cache behavior still matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Edge GB is billed regardless of hit rate, but cache misses can add origin egress costs.</li>
    <li>If your hit rate drops during deploys or incidents, your total spend can rise even with similar edge GB.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Region mix example</h2>
  <p>
    If 60% of your traffic is in North America at $0.05/GB and 40% is in APAC at $0.09/GB, your blended rate is
    (0.6 x 0.05) + (0.4 x 0.09) = $0.066/GB. That blended rate is what you should use for quick planning.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare your blended rate to the last invoice to confirm it is realistic.</li>
    <li>Check for traffic shifts to higher priced regions.</li>
    <li>Recalculate after major content changes (video, downloads, or large payloads).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Units and rounding pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Some providers bill in decimal GB, others in GiB; confirm before comparing.</li>
    <li>Billing dashboards may round at the line item level, which shifts the blended rate.</li>
    <li>Always compare on the same unit basis when benchmarking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When $/GB is not enough</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>High request volume: request fees can exceed bandwidth spend.</li>
    <li>Low cache hit rate: origin egress can add a second bill.</li>
    <li>Security add-ons: WAF and bot mitigation are request-driven.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What this does not include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Request fees</strong>: often billed per 10k or per 1M requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin egress</strong>: cache fill billed by your origin provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Log or analytics add-ons</strong>: some providers bill these separately.</li>
  </ul>
