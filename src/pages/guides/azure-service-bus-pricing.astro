  <p>
    Messaging cost estimation is “count the events”. The biggest mistakes are underestimating retries and ignoring fan-out
    (one publish → multiple deliveries). Model volume and payload separately.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Message volume (per month)</h2>
  <p>
    Start from messages/second or messages/day and convert to monthly volume. If your system bursts (batch jobs, cron runs),
    model peak windows separately.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Deliveries and retries</h2>
  <p>
    The true driver is often <strong>deliveries</strong>, not unique messages. If you retry 5× during an outage, you can 5×
    your delivery volume. DLQ reprocessing can also create additional deliveries.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Payload size and transfer</h2>
  <p>
    If messages carry large payloads (or references that trigger downloads), estimate data transfer separately. Multiply
    average payload size by delivery volume to get a GB/month ballpark.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate retries and DLQ replay patterns (deliveries, not just messages).</li>
    <li>Validate payload size distribution (don’t assume “small messages”).</li>
    <li>Validate fan-out (subscriptions) for each topic/queue.</li>
  </ul>
