  <p>
    For SNS pricing, <strong>deliveries</strong> (messages delivered to endpoints) are usually the main driver. A simple
    fan-out model gets you close quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: From publishes and fan-out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Deliveries/month ≈ publishes/month x avg subscribers per message</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Adjust fan-out by filter match rate (if filters drop most messages).</li>
    <li>Segment by topic: a few large topics often dominate total deliveries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: From metrics and logs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use SNS delivery metrics per topic/subscription if available.</li>
    <li>Track failure rate; high failure increases retries and cost.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 3: From downstream consumers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>For SQS subscriptions, queue message ingress can approximate deliveries.</li>
    <li>For HTTP endpoints, request logs can approximate deliveries (plus retries).</li>
  </ul>
