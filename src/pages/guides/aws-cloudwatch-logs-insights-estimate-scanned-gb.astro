  <p>
    Logs Insights is typically priced by <strong>GB scanned</strong>. If you don’t have measured “GB scanned” numbers yet,
    you can get a planning estimate from three inputs: <strong>log volume (GB/day)</strong>,{" "}
    <strong>time range per query</strong>, and <strong>query frequency</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: estimate log volume (GB/day)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use measured ingestion GB/day if you have it (best).</li>
    <li>If not, estimate from requests/day × bytes/log and convert to GB/day.</li>
    <li>Separate noisy success logs from error/security logs; they behave differently.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: estimate scanned GB per query</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    First-order approximation (single log group): scanned GB/query ~= (GB/day) × (query_hours / 24).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you query 1 hour of data, query_hours/24 ~= 1/24.</li>
    <li>If you query 7 days, query_hours/24 ~= 7.</li>
    <li>If you query multiple log groups, add them (or use total GB/day for those groups).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: estimate query frequency (the hidden driver)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Dashboards</strong>: users/day × dashboard views/day × refreshes/view.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ad-hoc queries</strong>: engineer queries/day (incident days can be 10–50× higher).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scheduled jobs</strong>: recurring searches and reports that run automatically.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn it into a monthly estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">Monthly scanned GB ~= scanned GB/query × queries/day × 30.4</p>

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/log-search-scan-cost-calculator/">Generic scan cost</a>
  </div>

  <h2>Worked example (planning)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ingestion for queried groups: 60 GB/day</li>
    <li>Typical time range: 2 hours -> query_hours/24 ~= 0.083</li>
    <li>Scanned GB/query ~= 60 * 0.083 ~= 5 GB/query</li>
    <li>Queries/day: 200 (dashboards + ad-hoc)</li>
    <li>Monthly scanned ~= 5 * 200 * 30.4 ~= 30,400 GB scanned/month</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">Treat this as an estimate and validate with measured scan data as soon as possible.</p>

  <h2>Incident multiplier (simple planning)</h2>
  <p>
    If you have 2 incident days per month where query volume is 10× higher and time ranges are wider, you can add a
    small “incident add-on” instead of pretending every day is identical.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incident add-on ~= (scanned/day during incidents - normal scanned/day) × incident days</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using a “last 30 days” default window for routine dashboards.</li>
    <li>Ignoring incident behavior (many repeated broad searches).</li>
    <li>Scanning noisy success logs to answer a question about errors.</li>
    <li>Not separating environments (prod vs staging) when modeling queries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure actual scanned GB from a representative week once you have access.</li>
    <li>Validate dashboards: time range, refresh rate, and number of queries executed per view.</li>
    <li>Validate which log groups are included in common queries (scope is the main lever).</li>
  </ul>
