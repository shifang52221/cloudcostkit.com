    Query scan cost depends on how many bytes your queries scan. You can estimate it from actual query metrics (best) or
    from query patterns and dataset size (good enough for planning).
  </p>

  <h2>1) From query metrics (best)</h2>
  <p>
    Use any available "bytes scanned" or "GB scanned" metrics per query and aggregate to a daily total. This gives you a
    direct input for the scan cost calculator.
  </p>

  <h2>2) From query patterns (scenario planning)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate:
    <br />
    <strong>scanned GB/day ~ queries/day x (GB in scope per query)</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    "GB in scope" is driven by the time range and how broad your query is. Narrow filters early to reduce scope.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Use a calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-logs-insights-cost-calculator/">Logs Insights Cost Calculator</a> to translate scanned
    GB/day into a monthly estimate.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Long time ranges by default (for example 30 days) for routine queries.</li>
    <li>Missing filters (scan everything then filter in the UI).</li>
    <li>Recurring dashboards that run broad queries frequently.</li>
    <li>Incident investigations that scan large datasets repeatedly.</li>
  </ul>
