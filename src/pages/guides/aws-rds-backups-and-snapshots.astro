  <p class="muted">
    Backup costs often surprise teams because they grow silently with retention and data churn. Plan backups as a separate
    storage bucket, not "part of the instance".
  </p>

  <h2>1) Separate three concepts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary DB storage</strong>: the allocated/used database size.</li>
    <li><strong>Backup retention</strong>: how many days/weeks of history you keep.</li>
    <li><strong>Churn</strong>: how much data changes each day (writes/updates).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) A quick planning estimate</h2>
  <p>
    If you don't have accurate snapshot sizes yet, estimate <strong>backup GB</strong> as:
    <br />
    <strong>backup GB ~ daily changed GB x retention days</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Validate against reality</h2>
  <p>
    Use your provider dashboards to inspect snapshot sizes and growth. If churn is bursty (batch jobs), model the busy
    weeks as a separate scenario.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Feed the estimate into the calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-rds-cost-calculator/">AWS RDS Cost Calculator</a> and set "backup storage (GB-month)" to
    your best estimate. Combine it with storage growth modeling via{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">DB storage growth</a>.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
