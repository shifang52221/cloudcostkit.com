  <p>
    CloudWatch dashboards are usually modeled as <strong>dashboard-month</strong>, but the “real” costs often live next
    door: <strong>metrics API requests</strong>, <strong>custom metrics</strong>, and <strong>alarms</strong> created to
    support dashboards and alerting.
  </p>

  <h2>Dashboard pricing inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dashboard count</strong>: billable dashboard-months.</li>
    <li><strong>Widget refresh</strong>: API requests per refresh.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewer traffic</strong>: shared dashboards multiply calls.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Dashboards</strong>: dashboard-month count (how many dashboards exist and are billed)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Metrics API requests</strong>: GetMetricData / GetMetricStatistics called by dashboards and tools
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Custom metrics volume</strong>: metrics you publish to support visualizations and SLOs
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Alarm-months</strong>: alarms created as “dashboard companions”
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>A fast estimation workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Count dashboards (prod vs non-prod).</li>
    <li>Estimate dashboard refresh traffic: users × views × refreshes.</li>
    <li>Estimate API requests: refreshes × widgets × metrics per widget.</li>
    <li>Apply dashboard-month and API request rates from your region pricing.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Worked example (order-of-magnitude)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Suppose 25 engineers open a dashboard 10 times/day, each view refreshes 5 times, and the dashboard has 20 widgets:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dashboard refreshes/day ~= 25 * 10 * 5 = 1,250</li>
    <li>If each widget queries ~3 metrics, metric queries/day ~= 1,250 * 20 * 3 = 75,000</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    This is why “dashboard sprawl” can create surprisingly large API request volume, even with normal usage patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Dashboard duplication</strong>: each team clones a dashboard pack instead of sharing a standard set.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-cardinality metrics</strong>: dashboards require per-dimension metrics that explode metric count.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Always-on refresh</strong>: wallboard TVs and NOC screens refresh continuously and drive constant queries.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tool overlap</strong>: multiple observability tools poll the same CloudWatch metrics in parallel.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-account views</strong>: shared dashboards across accounts can increase polling if multiple teams keep them open.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cost control levers (without losing visibility)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce duplication: maintain a shared “golden dashboard” per service.</li>
    <li>Reduce refresh: avoid 10-second refresh for slow-moving metrics.</li>
    <li>Reduce metrics per widget: aggregate where possible and avoid per-instance views by default.</li>
    <li>Move heavy exploration to logs/traces for investigations and keep dashboards for operational monitoring.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you need fast detection, prefer alarms for paging and keep dashboards optimized for triage rather than continuous
    high-frequency polling.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count dashboards by environment and by ownership/team.</li>
    <li>Identify “always-on” dashboards (TVs, wallboards) and measure their refresh rate.</li>
    <li>Measure metrics API request volume from a real week and validate the estimate.</li>
  </ul>
