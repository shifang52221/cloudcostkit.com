    CloudWatch-style dashboards are usually billed as a simple baseline (dashboard-month). The surprise is often not the
    dashboard line itself, but the way dashboards contribute to sprawl and API polling.
  </p>

  <h2>What to count</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dashboards</strong>: total dashboards that exist in the account (or per environment).</li>
    <li><strong>Environments</strong>: prod + staging + dev often multiply dashboard count.</li>
    <li><strong>Tenants/teams</strong>: per-tenant or per-team dashboards can balloon quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Refresh patterns</strong>: frequent refresh can increase metrics API requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p>
    Start by counting dashboards per environment, then add the obvious multipliers (teams, tenants). If you expect rapid
    growth, model a "future state" dashboard count rather than today's number.
  </p>

  <h2>Cost-control tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Consolidate dashboards (service-level) instead of per-entity dashboards.</li>
    <li>Delete old dashboards from experiments and migrations.</li>
    <li>Prefer templated dashboards or tags over duplicating dashboards per team.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify with a calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-metrics-cost-calculator/">CloudWatch Metrics Cost Calculator</a> to model
    dashboards plus the related line items (custom metrics, alarms, and API requests).
