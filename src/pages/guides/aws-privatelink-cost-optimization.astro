  <p>
    PrivateLink is usually deployed for security and simplicity, but it can create a second networking bill if endpoint
    sprawl grows. This guide focuses on the cost levers you can control safely.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Prevent endpoint sprawl</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Define a standard set of endpoints per environment (prod vs non-prod).</li>
    <li>Require ownership and lifecycle for each endpoint (who pays, who maintains).</li>
    <li>Remove unused endpoints created during migrations and experiments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce endpoint-hours (the main lever)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Consolidate duplicate endpoints where it is safe.</li>
    <li>Right-size AZ coverage (2 AZs vs 3 AZs scenarios).</li>
    <li>Keep endpoints always-on only when required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce GB processed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce retries and noisy polling.</li>
    <li>Cache responses where safe to cut repeated calls.</li>
    <li>Validate that only necessary traffic goes through the endpoint.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Avoid transfer boundary surprises</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Private traffic can still cross AZs/regions depending on routing and service placement. Validate locality and model
    transfer explicitly.

  <h2>Quantify with a calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-vpc-interface-endpoint-cost-calculator/">VPC Interface Endpoint Cost Calculator</a> to
    estimate endpoint-hours + per-GB processing, then compare against NAT:
