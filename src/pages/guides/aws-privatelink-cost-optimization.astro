  <p>
    PrivateLink is usually deployed for security and simplicity, but it can create a second networking bill if endpoint
    sprawl grows. The good news: the cost levers are simple and governable. This guide focuses on reducing{" "}
    <strong>endpoint-hours</strong>, preventing sprawl, and validating that the “private path” actually reduced your NAT
    and egress drivers.
  </p>

  <h2>The cost model (what to budget)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint-hours</strong> ≈ endpoints × AZs enabled × hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Traffic processing</strong> (if applicable) = GB processed × $/GB
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Total</strong> = endpoint-hours + processing + any transfer that still applies
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>1) Prevent endpoint sprawl (governance is the highest ROI)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Define a standard endpoint set per environment (prod vs non-prod).</li>
    <li>Require ownership and lifecycle for each endpoint (who pays, why it exists, when to delete).</li>
    <li>Tag endpoints by team/service and alert on new endpoints without an owner.</li>
    <li>Delete endpoints created for migrations and experiments after the project ends.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce endpoint-hours (the main lever)</h2>
  <p>
    Endpoint-hours grow with “count × AZs”. The best approach is to model 2–3 scenarios and pick the one that matches
    your availability requirements.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consolidate duplicates</strong>: avoid multiple endpoints for the same service per environment when one is enough.</li>
    <li><strong>Right-size AZ coverage</strong>: compare 2-AZ vs 3-AZ footprints for cost and risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-prod schedules</strong>: if non-prod isn’t used, consider deleting endpoints (and recreating when needed) instead of always-on sprawl.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce GB processed safely (avoid “private traffic amplification”)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cache where safe</strong>: reduce repeated calls to the same endpoints.</li>
    <li><strong>Fix retries/timeouts</strong>: incident windows can multiply calls and processed GB.</li>
    <li><strong>Stop noisy polling</strong>: high-frequency health checks and polling can create a steady baseline.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Prefer the simplest private option when it exists</h2>
  <p>
    Private connectivity isn’t one-size-fits-all. In some cases, a gateway-style private path can be simpler than adding
    many interface endpoints. The practical rule: choose the option that removes the most NAT traffic with the least
    always-on footprint — then validate in billing.

  <h2>5) Avoid transfer boundary surprises</h2>
  <p>
    Private traffic can still cross AZs/regions depending on routing and service placement. Validate locality and model
    transfer explicitly when architectures span AZs:

  </div>

  <h2>Validation checklist (after rollout)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm endpoint-hours match the intended footprint (no silent sprawl across AZs/environments).</li>
    <li>Confirm the expected NAT processed GB reduction actually happened.</li>
    <li>Check for shifted costs: cross-AZ transfer and internet egress lines.</li>
    <li>Verify reliability: endpoints used for critical paths should be monitored like production dependencies.</li>
  </ul>
