  <p>
    VPC data transfer costs often show up as "small" per-GB rates that become large at scale. The hard part is not the
    math - it is identifying how much traffic crosses pricing boundaries (AZ, region, and internet).
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Map the traffic boundary (draw the path)</h2>
  <p>
    Start with one real request path and draw it end-to-end: client -&gt; edge/CDN -&gt; load balancer -&gt; services -&gt;
    databases -&gt; third parties. Mark every place traffic crosses AZs, regions, or the public internet.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-AZ</strong>: service calls between instances in different AZs (often accidental)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-region</strong>: replication, multi-region reads, active-active patterns, failover tests
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet egress</strong>: responses to users/customers/partners and downloads
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT paths</strong>: private subnets reaching public endpoints or AWS services through NAT (often avoidable with endpoints)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Estimate GB/month (pick the best method you can)</h2>
  <h3>Method A: From billing exports (best for budgets)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In CUR/Cost Explorer, group by usage type and identify transfer-related line items.</li>
    <li>Break down by account and region so "one noisy VPC" does not hide.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Method B: From VPC Flow Logs (best for boundaries)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Roll up bytes by source/destination and map them to AZ and region boundaries.</li>
    <li>Use flow logs to validate whether a suspected cross-AZ path is real (and how big it is).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Method C: From throughput charts (good first pass)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Convert Mbps to GB/month with <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>.</li>
    <li>Apply a boundary share (for example, "30% of service traffic crosses AZ") and test sensitivity with low/medium/high scenarios.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Price the right path</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have GB/month per boundary, use a calculator with an effective $/GB for your situation (cross-AZ, cross-region, egress).

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Internet egress</a>
  </div>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-AZ GB/month</strong> = GB/month service-to-service calls that cross AZ
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-region GB/month</strong> = replication GB/month + cross-region reads GB/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet egress GB/month</strong> = bytes delivered to users/partners (separate CDN bandwidth from origin egress)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Total transfer cost</strong> = (cross-AZ cost) + (cross-region cost) + (egress cost)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Assuming "same region means free". Many billed paths are within a region (especially cross-AZ).</li>
    <li>Accidental cross-AZ traffic caused by load balancer routing and uneven capacity.</li>
    <li>Sending AWS-service traffic through NAT when a VPC endpoint would keep the path private (and may reduce cost).</li>
    <li>Double-counting CDN bandwidth and origin egress as the same GB.</li>
    <li>Unit errors: Mbps vs MB/s and GB vs GiB (use the Units Converter if needed).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>After one billing cycle, reconcile transfer usage types against your modeled GB/month boundaries.</li>
    <li>Spot-check one suspected path with flow logs to confirm the magnitude and direction.</li>
    <li>Re-run the estimate after major changes (new region, new CDN, new replication, new endpoints).</li>
  </ul>
