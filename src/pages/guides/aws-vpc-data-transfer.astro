  <p>
    VPC data transfer costs often show up as “small” per-GB rates that become large at scale. The hard part is usually
    estimating total GB/month across all the places data crosses pricing boundaries.
  </p>

  <h2>Where transfer hides</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cross-zone traffic between services in different AZs</li>
    <li>Cross-region replication and failover architectures</li>
    <li>Internet egress (downloads, APIs, web traffic)</li>
    <li>Batch pipelines moving large datasets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate GB/month</h2>
  <p>
    Use flow logs, load balancer metrics, or billing exports if available. If you only have throughput charts, convert
    Mbps to GB/month using the <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>.
