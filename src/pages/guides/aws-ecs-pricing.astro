  <p>
    ECS cost is mainly the cost of the <strong>compute you run on</strong> plus the infrastructure around it. The two
    common models are ECS on <strong>EC2 launch type</strong> (you pay for instances) and ECS on <strong>Fargate</strong>
    (you pay for vCPU-hours + memory GB-hours per running task).
  </p>

  <h2>What to include (minimum viable ECS model)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compute</strong>: EC2 instance-hours or Fargate vCPU/GB-hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Load balancers</strong>: ALB/NLB baseline + LCU/NLCU.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion + retention baseline (and query scan if applicable).</li>
    <li><strong>Networking</strong>: egress/NAT, cross-AZ traffic, and cross-region if you replicate.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: EBS (for EC2) and snapshots; task volumes where relevant.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Verbose logging can exceed compute cost.</li>

    <li>Multiple ALBs/NLBs create a large baseline even when services are quiet.</li>
