  <p>
    ECS cost is mainly the cost of the <strong>compute you run on</strong> plus the infrastructure around it. The two
    common models are ECS on <strong>EC2 launch type</strong> (you pay for instances) and ECS on{" "}
    <strong>Fargate</strong> (you pay for vCPU-hours + memory GB-hours per running task).
  </p>

  <h2>1) Compute (baseline)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>EC2 launch type</strong>: instance-hours, plus EBS if you attach volumes.</li>
    <li><strong>Fargate</strong>: vCPU-hours + memory GB-hours, scaled by running tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Idle matters</strong>: for EC2, paying for idle capacity is often the largest hidden multiplier.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Load balancers (baseline + capacity units)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>ALB/NLB hourly baseline per load balancer.</li>
    <li>Capacity units (LCU/NLCU) driven by connections, throughput, and rule evaluations.</li>
    <li>One load balancer per service can create a large baseline even when services are quiet.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>3) Logs and metrics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Log ingestion grows with request volume and verbosity.</li>
    <li>Retention creates a steady GB-month baseline.</li>
    <li>Query scans spike during incidents and heavy dashboards.</li>
    <li>Metrics costs grow with custom metric cardinality and polling.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>4) Networking (NAT, egress, cross-AZ)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>NAT gateway</strong>: hourly + GB processed can dominate private subnet workloads.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet egress</strong>: bytes leaving AWS to users/external systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-AZ transfer</strong>: microservice chatter and uneven placement can create internal transfer.</li>
  </ul>

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>
  </div>

  <h2>5) Storage (when you run on EC2)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>EBS volumes (GB-month + optional IOPS/throughput).</li>
    <li>Snapshots (change rate × retention).</li>
    <li>Stateful dependencies often dwarf the service compute line item.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>6) Registry behavior (ECR)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Storage grows with retention and CI push frequency.</li>
    <li>Pull traffic spikes during cluster autoscaling and cold starts.</li>
    <li>Cross-region pulls and NAT paths can change transfer costs materially.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Rule of thumb (sanity check)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If your service is quiet but your bill is high, look for baselines: load balancer hourly, NAT hourly, and retention
    (logs, snapshots, registry). If your traffic spikes, look for variable drivers: logs, transfer, and capacity units.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate average (not peak) running tasks and the busy-month scenario.</li>
    <li>Validate log ingestion GB/day and retention settings for each service.</li>
    <li>Validate NAT processed GB and egress GB for the real traffic paths.</li>
    <li>Validate load balancer count and whether they are shared across services.</li>
  </ul>
