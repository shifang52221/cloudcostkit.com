  <p class="muted">
    CloudWatch metrics costs usually come from too many unique series/metrics, too many alarms/dashboards, or excessive
    API polling. Fixing any one of these can reduce spend quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Remove high-cardinality dimensions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid per-pod or per-user labels unless they are required.</li>
    <li>Aggregate to service-level metrics when possible.</li>
    <li>Drop noisy, unused metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Clean up alarms and dashboards</h2>
  <p>
    Old experiments and migrated services often leave behind alarms and dashboards. Remove unused ones and consolidate
    dashboards where possible.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Reduce API polling/query frequency</h2>
  <p>
    If automation or dashboards fetch metrics frequently, tune refresh intervals and batch queries to reduce API request
    volume.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Validate with a calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-metrics-cost-calculator/">CloudWatch Metrics Cost Calculator</a> to see which line
    item dominates (metrics, alarms, dashboards, API), then optimize the right lever.
