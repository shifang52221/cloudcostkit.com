  <p>
    Application Insights is a telemetry pipeline. Costs are predictable if you model it as:
    <strong>events × size → GB ingested → retention storage → query scans</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Ingestion volume (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    A reliable first estimate is: <strong>requests × telemetry events per request × bytes per event</strong>. Model separate
    lines for high-volume sources (requests, dependencies, exceptions, traces) rather than one blended average.

  </p>

  <h2>2) Sampling</h2>
  <p>
    Sampling is the biggest cost lever. If you sample traces at 10%, your ingestion can drop ~10×. During incidents,
    exceptions and retries can multiply events, so sampling and filters matter.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Retention and query scans</h2>
  <p>
    Retention multiplies stored GB. Queries and dashboards can scan large windows repeatedly; model refresh frequency and
    scan windows explicitly.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate sampling and filters (especially traces) and confirm what is kept vs dropped.</li>
    <li>Validate incident behavior: errors/retries multiply telemetry events and ingestion volume.</li>
    <li>Validate dashboards/alerts for wide time windows that scan lots of data frequently.</li>
  </ul>
