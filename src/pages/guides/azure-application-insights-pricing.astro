  <p>
    Application Insights is a telemetry pipeline. Costs are predictable if you model it as:
    <strong>events * size -> GB ingested -> retention storage -> query scans</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define what you send</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Telemetry types</strong>: requests, dependencies, exceptions, traces, custom events.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-volume paths</strong>: a few endpoints often generate most traffic (and most telemetry).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline vs incident</strong>: incidents multiply errors, retries, and event sizes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Ingestion volume (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    A reliable first estimate is: <strong>requests * events per request * bytes per event</strong>. Model separate lines
    for high-volume sources rather than one blended average.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>2) Sampling (the biggest cost lever)</h2>
  <p>
    Sampling is the highest leverage knob. If you sample traces at 10%, ingestion can drop by ~10x for that stream. During
    incidents, exceptions and retries can multiply events, so sampling and filters matter.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer targeted full-fidelity for short windows (investigation) over always-on full-fidelity.</li>
    <li>Keep an incident plan: what gets sampled more or less when traffic spikes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Retention and query scans</h2>
  <p>
    Retention multiplies stored GB. Dashboards and alerts can scan large windows repeatedly; model refresh frequency and
    scan windows explicitly so the "analysis bill" does not surprise you.

  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ingestion GB/month</strong> = requests/month * events/request * bytes/event / 1e9 (approx)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retention GB-month</strong> = ingestion GB/day * retention days (order-of-magnitude)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Query scans</strong> = dashboard refreshes/day * scan window (days) * ingestion GB/day
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using one average: a few endpoints can dominate traffic and telemetry.</li>
    <li>Leaving traces at full fidelity for all services and all environments.</li>
    <li>Not accounting for incident multipliers (errors and retries can 10x event volume).</li>
    <li>Dashboards scanning wide windows frequently (quiet scan cost).</li>
    <li>Keeping long retention by default without a clear reason.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate sampling and filters and confirm what is kept vs dropped.</li>
    <li>Validate incident behavior: errors and retries multiply telemetry events and ingestion volume.</li>
    <li>Validate dashboards/alerts for wide time windows that scan lots of data frequently.</li>
  </ul>
