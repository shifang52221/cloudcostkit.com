  <p>
    Logging costs are predictable when you treat logs like data: bytes in, bytes stored, bytes scanned. The biggest wins come
    from controlling ingestion volume and retention.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Ingestion (GB)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate log bytes per event × events per second. Convert to GB/day and multiply by 30 for a monthly baseline. Model the
    biggest sources separately (ingress, audit, firewall, application logs).

  </p>

  <h2>2) Retention (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Retention is a GB-month problem. If you ingest 20 GB/day and retain 30 days, you store roughly 600 GB on average (before
    compression and tiering assumptions).

  </p>

  <h2>3) Query and scan</h2>
  <p>
    Queries and dashboards often scan far more data than expected. Count how many queries run per day and estimate GB scanned
    per query based on time window and filters.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the biggest sources and turn off or sample noisy logs first.</li>
    <li>Validate retention windows and whether long-term retention is needed for all sources.</li>
    <li>Validate dashboards/alerts for wide time windows that scan lots of data repeatedly.</li>
  </ul>
