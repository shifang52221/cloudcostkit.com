    Storage classes are a common source of confusion. Cheaper per-GB tiers can introduce retrieval, transition, and
    minimum storage duration effects that matter for bursty access patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>When storage classes change total cost</h2>
  <p>
    Storage classes are a trade: you pay less per GB-month in exchange for constraints (access latency, retrieval and transition fees,
    and minimum storage duration). The correct choice depends on access pattern shape, not on "how cold it feels".
  </p>

  <h2>How to model storage classes safely</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Split your data into a few access tiers (hot / warm / archive).</li>
    <li>Estimate average GB-month stored in each tier.</li>
    <li>Estimate retrieval GB/month for colder tiers.</li>
    <li>Model transitions if you move objects between tiers regularly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Decision checklist (pick the right tier)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Restore SLA</strong>: do you need seconds, minutes, or hours to access cold data?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Read frequency</strong>: monthly reads are different from weekly reads (archive can become expensive fast).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Object count</strong>: many small objects increase request-like costs and operational overhead.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lifecycle churn</strong>: do you overwrite/delete frequently (minimum duration matters)?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transition volume</strong>: how much data you move between tiers each month.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When archive fees matter</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Large restores for backfills or audits.</li>
    <li>Frequent "read after long retention" workflows.</li>
    <li>Short-lived data placed into tiers with minimum duration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ignoring minimum duration: deleting early can create effective waste.</li>
    <li>Ignoring retrieval: even small retrieval GB/month can matter at scale.</li>
    <li>Over-transitioning: moving objects too often creates transition fees.</li>
    <li>Forgetting transfer: delivery to users/CDNs can dominate storage cost.</li>
    <li>Assuming archive is best for analytics datasets that are rehydrated repeatedly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hot storage</strong> = GB-month (hot tier)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Warm storage</strong> = GB-month (warm tier) + transitions/month (if applicable)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Archive</strong> = GB-month (archive tier) + retrieval GB/month + retrieval requests/month
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate a tiering plan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Run a 30-day access analysis: bytes retrieved and objects retrieved by prefix/age bucket.</li>
    <li>Simulate a baseline and a peak month (backfills/audits) for retrieval volume.</li>
    <li>After rollout, reconcile retrieval and transition usage types against the model.</li>
  </ul>
