    Storage classes are a common source of confusion. Cheaper per-GB tiers can introduce retrieval, transition, and
    minimum storage duration effects that matter for bursty access patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>How to model storage classes safely</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Split your data into a few access tiers (hot / warm / archive).</li>
    <li>Estimate average GB-month stored in each tier.</li>
    <li>Estimate retrieval GB/month for colder tiers.</li>
    <li>Model transitions if you move objects between tiers regularly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When archive fees matter</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Large restores for backfills or audits.</li>
    <li>Frequent "read after long retention" workflows.</li>
    <li>Short-lived data placed into tiers with minimum duration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ignoring minimum duration: deleting early can create effective waste.</li>
    <li>Ignoring retrieval: even small retrieval GB/month can matter at scale.</li>
    <li>Over-transitioning: moving objects too often creates transition fees.</li>
    <li>Forgetting transfer: delivery to users/CDNs can dominate storage cost.</li>
  </ul>
