    Storage classes are a common source of confusion. “Cheaper per GB” tiers can introduce retrieval, transition, and
    minimum storage duration effects that matter for bursty access patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>How to model storage classes safely</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Split your data into a few access tiers (hot / warm / archive)</li>
    <li>Estimate average GB stored in each tier</li>
    <li>Estimate retrieval GB/month for colder tiers</li>
    <li>Model transitions if you move objects between tiers regularly</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When archive fees matter</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Large restores for backfills or audits</li>
    <li>Frequent “read after long retention” workflows</li>
    <li>Short-lived data placed into tiers with minimum duration</li>
  </ul>
