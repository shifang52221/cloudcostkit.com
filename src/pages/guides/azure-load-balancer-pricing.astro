  <p>
    L4 load balancer estimates are easiest when you treat them like a network device: it runs for a number of hours and it
    processes a volume of traffic. Split traffic into internal vs internet-facing.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Hours</h2>
  <p>Count load balancers per environment and multiply by hours per month.</p>

  <h2>2) Traffic processed (GB)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate monthly GB processed by converting RPS and average response size into total transfer. If you have multiple
    endpoints, model the highest-volume ones separately.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Egress</h2>
  <p>
    If traffic exits to the internet, egress is often the material line item. Treat egress as independent from load balancer
    “GB processed” and validate what is billed.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate internal vs internet traffic boundaries and where egress billing applies.</li>
    <li>Validate peak traffic and burst behavior (autoscaling and capacity planning depend on peaks).</li>
    <li>Validate retries/timeouts that multiply both request volume and transfer volume.</li>
  </ul>
