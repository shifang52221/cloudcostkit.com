    Concurrency isn't just a performance concern. At scale it can change cost via retries, timeouts, and extra invocations.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Concurrency drives throughput (and potential retries)</h2>
  <p>
    When concurrency is insufficient, requests can queue or time out, triggering retries upstream. Each retry increases
    invocations, which increases cost.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Cold starts can inflate billed duration</h2>
  <p>
    If cold starts add initialization time, your billed duration increases. The effect is most visible for short-running
    functions where initialization is a meaningful fraction of total time.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Watch for noisy failure patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Downstream throttling (databases/queues) leading to repeated retries.</li>
    <li>Large payloads increasing duration and sometimes transfer.</li>
    <li>Excess logging during incident loops.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Budget with scenarios</h2>
  <p>
    A good planning model includes at least two scenarios: "normal" and "incident/regression". Use the same pricing inputs
    and change only invocations and duration to see how sensitive cost is.
