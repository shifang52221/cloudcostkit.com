  <p>
    EC2 cost estimation is easy if you treat it as a <strong>small set of drivers</strong> instead of a long list of
    services. Start with compute hours, then add the few line items that usually explain the gap between “instance price”
    and the real bill.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: compute baseline (instances × hours × blended rate)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hours/month</strong>: use 730 (or 24 × 30.4) as a planning constant.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Uptime factor</strong>: dev/test scheduling is the biggest lever (8h/day weekdays is ~23% uptime).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Blended $/hour</strong>: one effective rate across on-demand, spot, and commitments.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 2: model EBS (often second biggest)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Volumes</strong>: GB-month plus IOPS/throughput when applicable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Snapshots</strong>: change rate × retention dominates, not just volume size.
    </li>
    <li>
      Common trap: orphaned volumes after instance replacement or auto scaling events.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 3: add networking (the common underestimate)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internet egress</strong>: bytes leaving AWS to users/external systems.</li>
    <li><strong>NAT gateways</strong>: hourly + GB processed can dominate private subnet workloads.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-AZ</strong>: traffic patterns that cross zones add internal transfer.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 4: add “around EC2” services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers</strong>: baseline hourly + capacity units (LCU/NLCU).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion + retention, and query scans during incidents.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Metrics</strong>: custom metrics and dashboard polling can be meaningful at scale.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Blended rate: how to avoid over-precision</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If you do not have perfect allocation data yet, a blended rate is a useful planning tool. You can make it more
    accurate by splitting into two buckets: baseline capacity (committed) and burst capacity (on-demand/spot).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Baseline: instances you expect to run all month</li>
    <li>Burst: instances that appear only during peaks or batch windows</li>
    <li>Non-prod: schedule down and model separately</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using peak instance count as the monthly baseline.</li>
    <li>Ignoring EBS snapshots and thinking “EBS is just GB-month”.</li>
    <li>Forgetting NAT processed GB for private workloads and container fleets.</li>
    <li>Ignoring cross-AZ patterns (load balancer routing and service chatter).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate uptime assumptions (prod vs non-prod scheduling).</li>
    <li>Validate EBS: volume classes and snapshot retention behavior.</li>
    <li>Validate top data transfer paths (egress + NAT + cross-AZ) for a real week.</li>
    <li>After your first month, reconcile estimate vs bill and update blended rates.</li>
  </ul>
