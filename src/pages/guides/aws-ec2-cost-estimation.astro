    q: "What is a blended rate?",
    a: "A single effective $/hour that averages across purchase options and instance mixes (on-demand, savings plans/reservations, spot). Blended rates simplify budgeting before you have perfect allocation.",

  <p>
    EC2 cost estimation is straightforward when you separate compute from everything around it. This guide focuses on the
    compute line item and how to choose realistic assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Compute baseline (the part everyone gets right)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Instances x $/hour x hours/month x uptime</strong></li>
    <li>Use <strong>uptime</strong> for dev/test scheduling (for example, 8h/day on weekdays).</li>
    <li>Use a <strong>blended $/hour</strong> if you mix on-demand and commitments.</li>
  </ul>

    <a href="/calculators/compute-instance-cost-calculator/">compute instance cost</a>).
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: Add EBS and snapshots (often the second-biggest line item)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>EBS volumes: GB-month plus any performance dimensions (depending on volume type).</li>
    <li>Snapshots: storage grows with churn and retention (not just volume size).</li>

      <a href="/calculators/aws-ebs-snapshot-cost-calculator/">EBS snapshot cost</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Add network transfer (the common under-estimate)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Internet egress to users or external systems.</li>
    <li>Cross-AZ / cross-region traffic caused by multi-AZ patterns and replication.</li>
    <li>

    </li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: Add the "around EC2" services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Load balancers: <a href="/calculators/aws-load-balancer-cost-calculator/">ALB/NLB cost</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      NAT gateway: <a href="/calculators/aws-nat-gateway-cost-calculator/">NAT gateway cost</a> (GB processed can dominate)
    </li>
    <li>
      Logs and metrics: <a href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">log ingestion</a> and{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/metrics-timeseries-cost-calculator/">metrics timeseries</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify uptime assumptions per environment (prod vs dev/test).</li>
    <li>Confirm whether traffic crosses AZs or regions in your architecture.</li>
    <li>Do a sanity check with a real week of billing/metrics once you have it.</li>
  </ul>
