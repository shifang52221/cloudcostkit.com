  <p>
    EC2 cost estimation is straightforward when you separate compute from everything around it. This guide focuses on the
    compute line item and how to choose realistic assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>Compute baseline</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instances × $/hour × hours/month × uptime</li>
    <li>Use a blended $/hour if you mix on-demand and commitments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Calculator: <a href="/calculators/ec2-cost-calculator/">EC2 cost calculator</a>.

  <h2>What people forget</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Storage (volumes, snapshots)</li>
    <li>Data transfer (egress, cross-zone/region)</li>
    <li>Load balancers and NAT gateways</li>
  </ul>
