  <p>
    Managed Kubernetes control plane fees are a fixed “per cluster” line item. They’re often small for a single
    production cluster, but they become meaningful when cluster count explodes (teams × environments × regions). This
    guide shows how to model the cost and when it’s worth paying for more clusters.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick estimation formula</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Control plane cost/month ≈ clusters × $/hour × 730</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Then add nodes and add-ons separately (nodes, storage, logs, load balancers, egress).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Tooling: <a href="/calculators/eks-cost-calculator/">EKS cost calculator</a> (control plane + nodes + common add-ons).
  </p>

  <h2>Why it sneaks up on teams</h2>
  <p>
    Cluster sprawl usually isn’t intentional. It happens through reasonable decisions that multiply:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every team wants isolation (one cluster per team).</li>
    <li>Every team wants environments (dev + stage + prod).</li>
    <li>Then regions get duplicated (us-east + eu-west).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    A quick mental model: 5 teams × 3 env × 2 regions = 30 clusters. Fixed fees add up even if nodes are tiny.
  </p>

  <h2>When paying for more clusters is worth it</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hard isolation requirements</strong>: compliance boundaries, noisy-neighbor risk, or strict blast radius.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operational autonomy</strong>: teams ship independently and need different Kubernetes versions or add-ons.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-region HA</strong>: duplicated clusters are a deliberate cost for resilience.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to keep control plane spend under control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Consolidate non-prod</strong>: use a shared dev/test cluster with namespaces, quotas, and policy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prefer ephemeral clusters</strong>: create clusters for CI/perf testing and delete them after the run.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Make “new cluster” a budgeted decision</strong>: require a short justification (why not namespace isolation?).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reduce add-on duplication</strong>: every cluster tends to pull in the same ingress, logging, and monitoring stack.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Counting only node-hours and forgetting the per-cluster fee.</li>
    <li>Always-on dev/test clusters that could be shared or ephemeral.</li>
    <li>Duplicating clusters across regions for “maybe someday” HA without a real requirement.</li>
    <li>Underestimating add-on overhead (logging/metrics/ingress) that scales with cluster count.</li>
    <li>Creating clusters to solve tenancy problems better handled with policy, quotas, and namespaces.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate (and find sprawl)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In Cost Explorer/CUR, filter to EKS and group by usage type to confirm the fixed hourly component.</li>
    <li>List all clusters by environment and region; compare to what’s actually receiving traffic.</li>
    <li>For each non-prod cluster, ask: could this be a namespace in a shared cluster?</li>
  </ul>
