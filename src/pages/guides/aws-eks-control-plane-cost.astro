  <p>
    Managed Kubernetes control plane fees are often a fixed hourly line item. They are small for large production
    clusters, but they can dominate costs for small dev/test clusters—especially if you run many clusters.
  </p>

  <h2>When it matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Many small clusters (per-team or per-environment)</li>
    <li>Always-on dev/test environments</li>
    <li>Multi-region clusters with duplicated control planes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to keep it under control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn off idle dev/test clusters (or schedule uptime)</li>
    <li>Consolidate non-prod workloads into fewer shared clusters</li>
    <li>Use namespaces and policy to isolate teams when appropriate</li>
  </ul>
