  },
  {
    q: "Should I use one big cluster or many small clusters?",
    a: "It's a trade-off: many clusters improve isolation and autonomy but increase fixed fees and operational overhead. For non-prod, fewer clusters is usually cheaper and simpler.",

  <p>
    Managed Kubernetes control plane fees are often a fixed hourly line item. They are small for large production
    clusters, but they can dominate costs for small dev/test clusters - especially if you run many clusters.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick estimation formula</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Control plane cost/month ~ clusters x $/hour x 730</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Then add node and add-on costs separately (nodes, storage, logs, load balancers, egress).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When it matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Many small clusters (per-team or per-environment)</li>
    <li>Always-on dev/test environments</li>
    <li>Multi-region clusters with duplicated control planes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to keep it under control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn off idle dev/test clusters (or schedule uptime)</li>
    <li>Consolidate non-prod workloads into fewer shared clusters</li>
    <li>Use namespaces and policy to isolate teams when appropriate</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Counting only nodes: the fixed fee still exists even with tiny node groups.</li>
    <li>Ignoring add-ons: logs, metrics, and load balancers can exceed the control plane fee.</li>
    <li>Multi-region duplication: cluster count grows quickly with region x environment.</li>
  </ul>
