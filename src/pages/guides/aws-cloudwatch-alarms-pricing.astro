    CloudWatch Alarms cost modeling is straightforward: count the alarms you maintain and apply the relevant{" "}
    <strong>$ per alarm-month</strong> rate by type.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Standard alarms</strong>: typical 1-minute evaluation period alarms
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-resolution alarms</strong>: shorter evaluation periods (more expensive)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Composite alarms</strong>: alarms built from other alarms
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Adjacent line items</strong>: metrics, logs, dashboards, and notifications
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-cloudwatch-alarms-cost-calculator/">AWS CloudWatch Alarms Cost Calculator</a> to estimate
    alarm charges from counts and pricing inputs, then add metrics/logs/dashboards if needed.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count alarms by type (standard vs high-resolution vs composite) and confirm they are actually needed.</li>
    <li>Remember adjacent costs: metrics, dashboards, logs ingestion, and notification delivery can dominate.</li>
    <li>Watch for growth drivers: per-service alarms and per-dimension alarms scale with infrastructure size.</li>
  </ul>
