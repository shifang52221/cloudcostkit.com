  <p>
    CloudWatch alarms pricing is straightforward once you model the right unit: <strong>alarm-month</strong>. Most
    estimation mistakes come from mixing alarm types or ignoring short-lived environments that still generate billable
    alarm-months.
  </p>

  <h2>Alarm pricing inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Standard alarms</strong>: count per metric and dimension.</li>
    <li><strong>High-res</strong>: 1-minute or 10-second alarms.</li>
    <li><strong>Composite</strong>: add-on charges by count.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>What to include in an estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Standard alarm-months</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-resolution alarm-months</strong> (if used)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Composite alarm-months</strong> (if used)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Downstream notifications</strong>: SNS topics, SMS, email, chat webhooks (separate services)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast modeling workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Count current alarms by type (standard/high-res/composite).</li>
    <li>Convert ephemeral environments into time-weighted alarm-months.</li>
    <li>Apply your region pricing to each alarm type.</li>
    <li>Add notification delivery costs separately (if meaningful for your volume).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How to separate alarm types (so rates are applied correctly)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Standard vs high-resolution</strong>: treat these as different buckets if your pricing differentiates.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Composite alarms</strong>: count them separately; composites are useful to reduce paging noise but still add alarm-months.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Non-prod</strong>: model prod and non-prod separately; many teams can reduce non-prod alarm packs safely.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked example (alarm-month math)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Production: 300 standard alarms active all month -> 300 alarm-months</li>
    <li>PR envs: 40 alarms per env, ~10 envs active per day -> 400 alarms/day</li>
    <li>Monthly PR alarm-months ~= 400 * 30.4 / 30.4 ~= 400 alarm-months</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    This is why “small” PR environments can dominate alarm-months if they create the full production alarm pack.
  </p>

  <h2>Don't forget adjacent costs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>SNS delivery</strong>: if you send SMS/email or high-volume notifications, model it separately.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Metrics and dashboards</strong>: alarms are often created alongside extra metrics and dashboards that add costs too.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Per-instance alarms at scale</strong>: alarm count grows with fleet size.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Full alarm packs in PR environments</strong>: short-lived stacks still add alarm-months.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Duplicate monitoring stacks</strong>: two tools create equivalent alarms for the same incident.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ignoring notification plumbing</strong>: SMS and high-volume messaging can be a separate cost driver.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Optimization direction</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If cost is high, do not start by deleting critical alarms. Start by removing unused alarms and replacing per-resource
    alarms with service-level signals.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate alarm counts from inventory and from IaC (two sources if possible).</li>
    <li>Separate prod vs non-prod and pro-rate ephemeral environments.</li>
    <li>Confirm alarm type usage (standard vs high-res vs composite) before applying rates.</li>
  </ul>
