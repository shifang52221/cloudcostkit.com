  <p>
    SES costs usually scale with <strong>emails sent</strong>. The best savings come from preventing duplicate sends,
    controlling retries, and reducing the payload size when you include large templates or attachments.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce volume and duplicates</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Send fewer notifications by batching or digesting where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Dedupe message IDs so retries don’t generate duplicate emails.</li>
    <li>Disable noisy non-prod email sending or route it to a sink.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Control retries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use exponential backoff and stop retrying after a sensible limit.</li>
    <li>Fix failure sources (timeouts, upstream dependencies) that trigger resend loops.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce payload size</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep templates lean; avoid embedding large images.</li>
    <li>Prefer links to downloads instead of large attachments when possible.</li>
  </ul>

    volume or smaller payloads.
