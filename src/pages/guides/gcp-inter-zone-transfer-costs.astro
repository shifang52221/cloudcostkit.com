  <p>
    Inter-zone transfer is a common hidden cost in distributed systems. It is easiest to control when you identify the few
    big cross-zone flows and either co-locate workloads or reduce chatty traffic patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Common sources of cross-zone traffic</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cross-zone load balancing when backends are in multiple zones.</li>
    <li>Multi-zone Kubernetes clusters with chatty east-west traffic.</li>
    <li>Databases or caches accessed from another zone.</li>
    <li>Service meshes and retries that amplify traffic volume.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Estimate GB/month per flow</h2>
  <p>
    For each major flow, estimate average Mbps or average response size × request volume. Then convert to monthly GB.

    <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Transfer cost model</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Control levers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce retries/timeouts (they repeat full payload transfers).</li>
    <li>Reduce chattiness (batch calls, compress payloads, cache responses).</li>
    <li>Co-locate tightly coupled services within the same zone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate topology: which zones each service and database runs in.</li>
    <li>Validate load balancer distribution and cross-zone behavior.</li>
    <li>Validate retries and incident windows (multipliers matter).</li>
  </ul>
