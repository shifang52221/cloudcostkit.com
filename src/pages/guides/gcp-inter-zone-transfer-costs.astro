  <p>
    Inter-zone transfer is a common hidden cost in distributed systems. It is easiest to control when you identify the few
    big cross-zone flows and either co-locate workloads or reduce chatty traffic patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Definitions (so you measure the right thing)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Inter-zone</strong>: traffic crossing zones inside the same region.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inter-region</strong>: traffic crossing regions (often a different magnitude and different fixes).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet egress</strong>: outbound traffic to the public internet or external networks.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Common sources of cross-zone traffic</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cross-zone load balancing when backends span multiple zones.</li>
    <li>Multi-zone Kubernetes clusters with chatty east-west traffic.</li>
    <li>Databases/caches accessed from another zone.</li>
    <li>Service meshes and retries that amplify traffic volume.</li>
    <li>Deployments: image pulls and artifact fetches (bursty, but large).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Estimate GB/month per flow (start with the top 5)</h2>
  <p>
    The fastest method is to identify a handful of major flows and estimate each flow's GB/month. You can estimate from
    either Mbps metrics or from requests x average payload size.

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep baseline vs peak separate; retries during incidents create multiplier effects.</li>
    <li>Split large endpoints (downloads/exports) so they do not disappear into a blended average.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Flow</strong>: source zone(s) -&gt; destination zone(s)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong> = baseline + peak (include retries)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avg bytes/request</strong> = payload + headers (estimate or measure)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GB/month</strong> = requests/month x avg bytes/request
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Control levers (match to the flow)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce retries/timeouts (they repeat full payload transfers).</li>
    <li>Reduce chattiness (batch calls, cache responses, compress payloads).</li>
    <li>Co-locate tightly coupled services within the same zone.</li>
    <li>Pin stateful backends to the same zone as the largest callers where possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate topology: which zones each service and database runs in.</li>
    <li>Validate load balancer distribution and cross-zone behavior.</li>
    <li>Validate retries and incident windows (multipliers matter).</li>
    <li>Validate deployment traffic (artifact/image pulls) as a separate peak window.</li>
  </ul>
