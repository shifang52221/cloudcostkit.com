      q: "What's the fastest way to compare options?",

  <p>
    People often compare API Gateway, ALB, and CloudFront as “three ways to serve traffic”. Cost comparisons go wrong
    when you compare only one line item (like request price) and ignore transfer, caching, and add-ons.
  </p>

  <h2>Start with the same inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong> (baseline + busy-month scenario)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Average response size</strong> over the wire (compressed)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cacheability</strong> (expected cache hit rate if using a CDN)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Traffic path</strong> (internet vs private/VPC, cross-region boundaries)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What you pay for (high-level)</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Primary drivers</th>
        <th>Common “hidden” drivers</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>API Gateway</td>
        <td>Requests + transfer</td>
        <td>Access logs, WAF, downstream compute (Lambda), retries</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ALB</td>
        <td>Hours + processed data / capacity units</td>
        <td>Cross-zone, logs, WAF, upstream compute, health check traffic</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CloudFront</td>
        <td>Edge bandwidth + edge requests</td>
        <td>Origin egress (cache misses), invalidations, logs/analytics</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Why CloudFront can change the answer</h2>
  <p>
    CloudFront doesn’t replace an API by itself; it changes the traffic profile. If responses are cacheable, a CDN can
    reduce the number of origin/API requests and the amount of origin transfer, which often matters more than the per
    request price.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Origin requests/month ~= edge requests/month × (1 - cache hit rate)
    </li>
    <li>
      Origin egress GB/month ~= edge bandwidth GB/month × (1 - cache hit rate)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast comparison workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Estimate requests/month: <a href="/guides/aws-api-gateway-estimate-requests/">request volume methods</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Estimate transfer from response size: <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">response size
      to transfer</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Model API request + transfer with <a href="/calculators/aws-api-gateway-cost-calculator/">API Gateway cost
      calculator</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Model CDN bandwidth/requests with <a href="/calculators/cloudfront-cost-calculator/">CloudFront cost calculator</a>{" "}
      (or <a href="/calculators/cdn-cost-calculator/">generic CDN</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Model ALB with <a href="/calculators/aws-load-balancer-cost-calculator/">AWS load balancer cost calculator</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add add-ons as separate line items: <a href="/calculators/aws-waf-cost-calculator/">WAF</a>, logs, custom domains,
      and any downstream compute.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing only request fees and ignoring transfer (often dominates for non-trivial payloads).</li>
    <li>Using uncompressed payload sizes (overstates transfer).</li>
    <li>Assuming a cache hit rate without validating cacheability and caching headers.</li>
    <li>Ignoring retries/timeouts (can multiply requests and bytes during incidents).</li>
    <li>Forgetting log/analytics costs (CloudWatch, S3, Athena, SIEM ingestion).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate a real week of requests and transfer from metrics/logs (not only peak RPS).</li>
    <li>Validate cache hit rate with a test distribution before committing to a CDN-driven savings claim.</li>
    <li>Confirm pricing boundaries: region, internet egress vs internal transfer, and which layer emits logs.</li>
  </ul>
