    q: "Where does CloudFront fit in?",

  <p>
    People often compare API Gateway, ALB, and CloudFront as "three ways to serve traffic". Cost comparisons go wrong
    when you compare only one line item (like request price) and ignore transfer, caching, and add-ons.
  </p>

  <h2>Start with the same inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Requests/month</strong> (average + peak scenarios)</li>
    <li><strong>Average response size</strong> (compressed over the wire)</li>
    <li><strong>Cacheability</strong> (hit rate if you can cache)</li>
    <li><strong>Traffic path</strong> (internet vs private/VPC, cross-region, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Core cost buckets</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Request-based charges</strong>: per request or per million requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Data transfer</strong>: $/GB for bytes delivered (and sometimes processed).</li>
    <li><strong>Add-ons</strong>: WAF, logs, custom domains/certs, caching, and other features you rely on.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When each option tends to win</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>API Gateway</strong>: often chosen for API features (auth, throttling, usage plans). Cost sensitivity is
      mainly requests + response bytes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ALB</strong>: can be cost-effective for steady high throughput and flexible routing. Data processed/LCU
      style billing can be the main driver.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CloudFront</strong>: wins when caching reduces API/origin requests or when bandwidth dominates. Even when
      CDN adds cost, it can reduce total system spend by cutting upstream load.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
