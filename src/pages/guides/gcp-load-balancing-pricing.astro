  <p>
    Load balancer estimates get accurate when you treat them as: hours + requests + traffic processed. Egress is usually a
    separate, often larger line item for public services.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Hours</h2>
  <p>Count load balancers and hours per month per environment.</p>

  <h2>2) Requests</h2>
  <p>Convert RPS to monthly requests and split high-volume endpoints if needed.</p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS → requests</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Traffic processed and egress</h2>
  <p>
    Use average response size to estimate GB transferred. Split origin egress vs CDN edge bandwidth and validate cache hit
    rate behavior if you use a CDN.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak traffic and burst behavior (capacity and scaling depend on peaks).</li>
    <li>Validate retries/timeouts that multiply request volume and transfer volume.</li>
    <li>Validate CDN usage and avoid double-counting origin egress and edge bandwidth.</li>
  </ul>
