  <p>
    Load balancer estimates get accurate when you treat them as: hours + requests + traffic processed. For public services,
    internet egress is usually a separate (often larger) line item. Splitting these drivers also makes optimization obvious.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Decide what you are pricing</h2>
  <p>
    Different load balancer types have different billing units. For budgeting, most teams can start with these measurable
    drivers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hours</strong>: how many LBs (and environments) are always on.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong>: baseline + peak requests/month (include retries).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Traffic processed</strong>: GB/month through the LB (response size is the key input).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress</strong>: outbound GB/month to the internet (or cross-region if applicable).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Hours (count always-on infrastructure)</h2>
  <p>Count load balancers and hours per month per environment (prod, staging, dev).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Always-on staging environments add up quickly.</li>
    <li>Count internal and external LBs separately if you use both.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Requests (baseline and peak)</h2>
  <p>Convert RPS to monthly requests and split heavy endpoints if needed.</p>

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Traffic processed: estimate GB from response size</h2>
  <p>
    If you know requests/month and average response bytes, you can estimate transfer. Keep a separate line item for heavy
    endpoints so they do not disappear into a blended average.
  </p>

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">Response transfer</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Egress: separate it from LB processing</h2>
  <p>
    Internet egress is often larger than LB processing for public services. If you use a CDN, keep origin egress (cache fill)
    separate from edge bandwidth to avoid double-counting.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN bandwidth</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>LB hours</strong> = LB count x hours/month (prod + non-prod)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong> = baseline + peak requests/month (include retries)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Traffic processed</strong> = requests/month x avg response bytes (split heavy endpoints)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress</strong> = outbound GB/month (internet + cross-region if applicable)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Not splitting LB processing vs egress (leads to the wrong optimization).</li>
    <li>Using one average response size and missing a heavy-tail endpoint.</li>
    <li>Not modeling peak windows and retry storms (multipliers matter).</li>
    <li>Double-counting CDN edge bandwidth and origin egress.</li>
  </ul>
