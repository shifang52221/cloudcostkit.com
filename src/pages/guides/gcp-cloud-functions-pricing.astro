  <p>
    The best Cloud Functions estimate is a “unit economics” model: per-invocation cost drivers multiplied by monthly volume.
    Keep compute, transfer, and logs as separate lines.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Invocations</h2>
  <p>
    Convert your trigger source to monthly invocations (HTTP RPS, Pub/Sub messages, scheduler triggers). Model peak periods
    separately if you have bursty traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS → monthly requests</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Duration</h2>
  <p>Use p50 and p95 duration to model steady-state and spikes. Spikes often come from upstream latency and retries.</p>

  <h2>3) Transfer and egress</h2>
  <p>Response size and outbound calls can make egress large. Estimate average response size and outbound GB separately.</p>
  <p>
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">Response transfer</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Logs</h2>
  <p>
    Multiply bytes logged per invocation by invocation volume to estimate ingestion. Add retention and scan costs if you run
    frequent queries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">Log cost tools</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate retry behavior (each retry multiplies invocations and transfer).</li>
    <li>Validate p95 duration and cold-start periods.</li>
    <li>Validate log volume per invocation and retention policies.</li>
  </ul>
