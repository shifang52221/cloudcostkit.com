  <p>
    A good cloud estimate is not a perfect number on day 1. It's a model with explicit drivers, clear assumptions, and a
    validation loop. This checklist helps you avoid "thin estimates" that ignore the parts of the bill that often dominate
    at scale: <strong>requests</strong>, <strong>transfer</strong>, and <strong>observability</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Output artifacts (what you should produce)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Line-item table</strong>: each item has (driver, unit price, baseline, peak, notes).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Assumptions list</strong>: what you assumed and how to measure later.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Validation plan</strong>: which metrics/billing reports you will compare against after launch.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Choose primary drivers (measure first)</h2>
  <p>
    If you cannot name a driver, you cannot validate. Pick the smallest set of drivers that explain most of the cost.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong>: APIs, queues, databases, CDN requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GB/day or GB/month</strong>: egress, CDN bandwidth, replication, backups, scan volume.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hours</strong>: instances, managed capacity, always-on gateways.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GB-month stored</strong>: storage, logs retained, snapshots/backups.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Time series / cardinality</strong>: metrics scale with series count and retention.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Model the big five buckets (with calculators)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Compute</strong>: instance-hours or vCPU/RAM hours (include headroom).
      <span class="muted">
        {" "}
        Tool: <a href="/calculators/compute-instance-cost-calculator/">Compute instance cost</a>.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong>: request-based services add up (per 10k, per 1M, per 100k).
      <span class="muted">
        {" "}
        Tools: <a href="/calculators/api-request-cost-calculator/">API request cost</a>,{" "}
        <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN request cost</a>,{" "}
        <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Network transfer</strong>: internet egress, cross-region, cross-zone.
      <span class="muted">
        {" "}
        Tools: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>,{" "}
        <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">Cross-region transfer</a>.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong>: base GB-month plus growth and replication.
      <span class="muted">
        {" "}
        Tools: <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object storage cost</a>,{" "}
        <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">Storage growth</a>.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Observability</strong>: logs, metrics, traces (ingestion + retention + scan/search).
      <span class="muted">
        {" "}
        Tools: <a href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">Log ingestion</a>,{" "}
        <a href="/calculators/log-storage-cost-calculator/">Tiered log storage</a>,{" "}
        <a href="/calculators/log-search-scan-cost-calculator/">Log scan/search</a>,{" "}
        <a href="/calculators/metrics-timeseries-cost-calculator/">Metrics time series</a>.
      </span>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3) Add the multipliers most teams forget</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline vs peak</strong>: peak windows (deploys, incidents) drive real spend and capacity decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retries/timeouts</strong>: multiply requests, transfer, and downstream dependency calls.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cache hit rate</strong>: affects origin egress and origin request volume behind a CDN.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Region mix</strong>: a blended effective $/GB across regions is more accurate than one global number.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Growth</strong>: "flat storage" is usually wrong; model growth and average GB-month.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Avoid double counting (the most common trap)</h2>
  <p>
    Most estimate errors are not missing a line item. They are counting the same bytes or requests twice under different
    names.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>CDN bandwidth vs origin egress</strong>: edge GB delivered is not the same as origin GB on cache misses.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ingestion vs storage vs scan</strong>: logs can have three separate charges; do not treat them as one.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Request fees vs transfer fees</strong>: request-based pricing does not include GB unless the vendor says it does.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Replication transfer vs storage</strong>: replication can be both extra transfer and extra stored GB.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backup retention vs primary storage</strong>: backup copies are not free by default; model retention explicitly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Worksheet template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <p class="muted">Use one row per line item. The important part is explicit drivers and explicit units.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Line item</strong>: name (e.g., "CDN requests", "Log ingestion", "Cross-region transfer")
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Driver</strong>: requests/month OR GB/day OR hours/month OR GB-month OR series-month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline</strong>: numeric value + explanation of where it comes from
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak</strong>: numeric value + what causes it (deploy, incident, batch job)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unit price</strong>: $ per unit (note the unit: per 10k, per 1M, per GB, per GB-month)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Owner</strong>: who will validate and own the lever (app team, infra, data)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Validation loop (what to do after launch)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 1</strong>: compare estimate drivers to real metrics (requests/day, GB/day, retained GB).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 2</strong>: compare estimate totals to billing exports; reconcile mismatches by line item.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Monthly</strong>: re-estimate with growth trends and update baseline/peak assumptions.
    </li>
  </ul>
