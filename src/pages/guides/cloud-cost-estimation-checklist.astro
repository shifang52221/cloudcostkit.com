  <p class="muted">
    This is the checklist we use to keep cloud cost estimates from becoming "compute-only" spreadsheets. The goal is not
    perfect precision on day 1. The goal is to include the big line items, validate units, and build a model you can
    refine.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Choose your primary drivers (measure first)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Requests/month</strong>: APIs, CDN, queue, database calls.</li>
    <li><strong>GB/month</strong>: egress, CDN bandwidth, replication, backups.</li>
    <li><strong>Instance-hours</strong>: VMs, managed node groups, workers.</li>
    <li><strong>GB-month stored</strong>: object storage, block volumes, logs retained.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Model the big five cost buckets</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Compute</strong>: instance-hours or vCPU/RAM hours (include headroom). Tool:{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/compute-instance-cost-calculator/">compute instance cost</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong>: request-based services add up. Tools:{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/api-request-cost-calculator/">API request cost</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN request cost</a>, and{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS -&gt; monthly requests</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Network transfer</strong>: internet egress, cross-region, cross-AZ. Tools:{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">egress cost</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">cross-region transfer</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong>: base GB-month plus growth, replicas, and request fees. Tools:{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">object storage cost</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">storage growth</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Observability</strong>: logs, metrics, traces (ingestion + retention + query/scan). Tools:{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">log ingestion</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/log-search-scan-cost-calculator/">log scan</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/metrics-timeseries-cost-calculator/">metrics timeseries</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Step 3: Add the missing-but-common multipliers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retries/timeouts</strong>: multiply requests and transfer during incidents.</li>
    <li><strong>Region mix</strong>: blended rate across regions is usually more accurate than a single $/GB.</li>
    <li><strong>Cache hit rate</strong>: affects origin egress and origin requests behind a CDN.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth</strong>: a "flat" storage estimate is almost always wrong over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: Validate (the part most teams skip)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Validate units: GB vs GiB, and request units (per 10k vs per 1M). Use{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Separate <strong>CDN bandwidth</strong> from <strong>origin egress</strong> (cache fill). Guide:{" "}
      <a href="/guides/origin-egress-vs-cdn-bandwidth/">origin egress vs CDN bandwidth</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Recompute with a real week of metrics to make sure directionality matches.</li>
  </ul>
