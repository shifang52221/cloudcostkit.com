  <p>
    If you're choosing between <strong>cross-region replication (CRR)</strong> and <strong>same-region replication (SRR)</strong>,
    the cost difference usually comes down to one thing: whether replicated bytes are billed like cross-region transfer.
    This checklist helps you compare the real line items.
  </p>

  <h2>Start with the same 3 buckets</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Replicated data (GB/month)</strong>: the changed data copied from source to destination.</li>
    <li><strong>Replica storage</strong>: you store (almost) the same objects twice.</li>
    <li><strong>Extra requests</strong>: replication can increase PUT/GET/LIST/HEAD activity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What changes between CRR and SRR</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>CRR</strong>: often includes cross-region transfer-like charges (or a per-GB replication fee, or both).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>SRR</strong>: avoids cross-region transfer, but still duplicates storage and may add request costs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 1: estimate replicated GB/month (changed data)</h2>
  <p>
    The biggest modeling mistake is using total bucket size. Replication volume is driven by writes and churn. Use this guide:
    <a href="/guides/estimate-replication-gb-per-month-from-writes/"> estimate replication GB/month</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: price the per-GB replication line item</h2>
  <p>
    Use a per-GB assumption based on your plan:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/calculators/s3-replication-cost-calculator/">S3 replication cost calculator</a> (S3-focused)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/calculators/storage-replication-cost-calculator/">Storage replication cost calculator</a> (generic)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">Cross-region transfer cost</a> (if billed as transfer)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: add replica storage</h2>
  <p>
    Treat replica storage as a separate ongoing line item (GB-month). Use{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object storage cost calculator</a> and add the replica stored GB
    as another storage line item.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 4: sanity-check request fees</h2>
  <p>
    For millions of small objects, request fees can matter. Use{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/s3-request-cost-calculator/">S3 request cost calculator</a> or model requests in the{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object storage cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist (before you choose CRR vs SRR)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate your goal: DR/multi-region reads (CRR) vs durability inside a region (SRR).</li>
    <li>Validate replicated GB/month from write volume and churn (do not use bucket size).</li>
    <li>Validate destination storage class and lifecycle policies (replica defaults matter).</li>
    <li>Validate whether replication is billed as a feature fee, transfer, or both in your provider/region.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked comparison template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Replicated GB/month</strong> = changed data per month (baseline + peak)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CRR per-GB fee</strong> = replication/transfer line item (if applicable)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>SRR per-GB fee</strong> = replication line item (usually lower transfer component)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Replica storage</strong> = destination GB-month (by storage class)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong> = extra PUT/GET/LIST/HEAD per month (many small objects scenario)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing CRR vs SRR based on total bucket size instead of changed data per month.</li>
    <li>Forgetting destination storage class (replica defaults to hot tier unless configured).</li>
    <li>Ignoring peak replication windows (deployments/backfills can spike changed data).</li>
  </ul>
