  <p class="muted">
    NAT Gateway costs scale with GB processed, so your budget depends on getting this number roughly right. Use one of the
    methods below depending on what data you have.
  </p>

  <h2>1) From NAT metrics (best)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Aggregate total bytes processed over 7-30 days and convert to GB. This is the most reliable approach because it
    measures exactly what is billed as processed traffic.
  </p>

  <h2>2) From VPC Flow Logs</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Filter flow logs for traffic that traverses the NAT gateway ENIs and sum bytes. Convert to GB/month.
  </p>

  <h2>3) From throughput (Mbps) charts</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If you only have average throughput (Mbps), convert it to GB/month. Use{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a> to avoid mixing GB and GiB.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Sanity-check common sources</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>OS/package updates behind NAT</li>
    <li>Container image pulls (CI/CD and scaling events)</li>
    <li>External APIs and SaaS traffic</li>
    <li>Log shipping to external destinations</li>
  </ul>
