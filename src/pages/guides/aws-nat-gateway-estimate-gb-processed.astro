  <p>
    NAT Gateway processing charges scale with <strong>GB processed</strong>, so your budget depends on getting this number
    roughly right. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s a defensible baseline plus a peak/incident scenario. Use the method
    that matches the data you have today, then validate with metrics later.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1) From NAT metrics (best)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick a representative window (7–30 days) and sum bytes processed.</li>
    <li>Convert bytes → GB using the same convention you use for pricing (and keep it consistent).</li>
    <li>Scale to monthly: GB/month ≈ GB/window × (30 / days in window).</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="muted">
    Use this whenever possible because it directly measures the billed driver.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 2) From VPC Flow Logs (good for attribution)</h2>
  <p>
    Flow logs are useful when you need to answer “what produced the GB?”. A practical workflow:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Filter flow logs to traffic that traverses NAT gateway ENIs.</li>
    <li>Group by destination (top domains/IPs) and source (top subnets/workloads).</li>
    <li>Sum bytes and convert to GB/month.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="muted">
    This method is slower but helps you find the 2–3 sources that actually matter (images, updates, external APIs).
  </p>

  <h2>Method 3) From throughput charts (Mbps) (fast first pass)</h2>
  <p>
    If you only have an “average Mbps” chart, you can estimate monthly GB with a units converter. Steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start from average Mbps (not peak).</li>
    <li>Apply utilization: if the chart is peak, multiply by an average factor you can defend.</li>
    <li>Convert Mbps → GB/month with consistent units.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="muted">

  </p>

  <h2>Method 4) Sanity-check from common sources (useful when data is missing)</h2>
  <p>
    If you have no metrics yet, estimate the big buckets and add them:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Image pulls</strong>: image size × pulls/month × fleet size</li>
    <li><strong>Updates</strong>: update GB/week × nodes × weeks/month</li>
    <li><strong>External APIs</strong>: requests/month × avg payload size (GB)</li>
    <li><strong>Log shipping</strong>: log export GB/day × days/month</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    This is crude but helps you avoid pretending it’s zero.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked example (structure, not provider-specific rates)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Representative week metrics: 1.2 TB processed in 7 days</li>
    <li>Scale to month: (1.2 TB / 7) × 30 ≈ 5.1 TB/month</li>
    <li>Price: 5.1 TB × $/GB + gateway-hours × $/hour</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare estimate vs real processed-bytes metrics for a week after deployment.</li>
    <li>Identify the top 3 sources (images, updates, APIs) and verify they match expectations.</li>
    <li>Include an incident scenario: retries often dominate monthly peaks.</li>
    <li>After changes, confirm GB processed dropped (not just moved to transfer/egress elsewhere).</li>
  </ul>
