    NAT Gateway costs scale with GB processed, so your budget depends on getting this number roughly right. Use one of the
    methods below depending on what data you have.
  </p>

  <h2>1) From NAT metrics (best)</h2>
  <p>
    If you have NAT Gateway metrics, aggregate total bytes processed over 30 days and convert to GB. This is the most
    reliable approach because it measures exactly what is billed as processed traffic.
  </p>

  <h2>2) From VPC Flow Logs</h2>
  <p>
    If you export flow logs, filter for traffic that traverses the NAT gateway ENIs and sum bytes. Convert to GB/month.
  </p>

  <h2>3) From throughput (Mbps) charts</h2>
  <p>
    If you only have average throughput (Mbps), convert it to GB/month. Use{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a> to avoid mixing GB and GiB.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Sanity-check common sources</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>OS/package updates behind NAT</li>
    <li>Container image pulls (CI/CD, scaling events)</li>
    <li>External APIs and SaaS traffic</li>
    <li>Log shipping to external destinations</li>
  </ul>
