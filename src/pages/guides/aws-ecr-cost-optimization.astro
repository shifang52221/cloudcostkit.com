  <p>
    ECR cost reduction is mostly about <strong>reducing stored GB-month</strong> and avoiding unnecessary transfer. The
    highest impact changes are operational, not micro-optimizations.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Enforce retention policies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep only the last N tags per repo (or last D days) for CI images.</li>
    <li>Delete untagged images and old build artifacts.</li>
    <li>Keep long retention only for pinned releases and rollback candidates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Shrink images</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use multi-stage builds and slim base images.</li>
    <li>Remove build tools and caches from runtime images.</li>
    <li>Prefer fewer layers and avoid copying large artifacts unintentionally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce redundant pulls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use node-level caching and avoid re-pulling identical tags unnecessarily.</li>
    <li>Keep CI runners and clusters in the same region/account where possible.</li>
    <li>Use immutable tags/digests to avoid accidental cache misses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify savings</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-ecr-cost-calculator/">AWS ECR Cost Calculator</a> to estimate savings from reducing stored
    GB-month or egress GB/month.
