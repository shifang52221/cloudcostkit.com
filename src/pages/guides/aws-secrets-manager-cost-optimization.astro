  <p>
    Secrets Manager cost reduction is mostly about reducing <strong>GetSecretValue</strong> volume while keeping secret
    handling safe and reliable.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Cache secrets</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fetch secrets once per process startup and cache in memory.</li>
    <li>Add a refresh TTL (minutes, not seconds) for long-running services.</li>
    <li>Batch access patterns and avoid redundant calls.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Avoid per-request lookups</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not call Secrets Manager on every incoming request.</li>
    <li>Prefer connection pooling and reuse for database credentials when possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce churn-driven fetches</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce pod churn and cold starts where possible.</li>
    <li>Fix retry loops that multiply secret fetches during incidents.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify impact</h2>
