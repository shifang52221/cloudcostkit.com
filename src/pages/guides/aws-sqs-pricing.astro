    SQS costs are usually predictable: estimate monthly messages, convert to monthly requests, then multiply by $ per 1M
    requests. Most surprises come from retries and extra receive/delete activity.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Start with messages per month</h2>
  <p>
    If you know throughput (messages/sec), convert to monthly volume first. Use{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a> as a rough helper.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Convert messages into requests</h2>
  <p>
    A common baseline is <strong>3 requests per message</strong>: Send + Receive + Delete. Add more if you have retries,
    visibility extensions, or receive polling behavior that increases API calls.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Price it with your effective rate</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-sqs-cost-calculator/">AWS SQS Cost Calculator</a> and plug in your region/queue type
    effective $ per 1M requests.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retry storms</strong>: timeouts, throttling, and poison messages multiplying requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Too many receives</strong>: aggressive polling and short visibility timeouts.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring downstream</strong>: Lambda, logs, or database writes can dominate total architecture cost.</li>
  </ul>
