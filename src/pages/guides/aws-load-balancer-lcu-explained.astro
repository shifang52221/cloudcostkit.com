    Many load balancers charge a fixed hourly fee plus a usage fee billed in capacity unit-hours (LCU for ALB, NLCU for
    NLB). For budgeting, you want an approximate average units/hour and a peak scenario.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Estimate average units per hour</h2>
  <p>
    Start with the simplest thing you can measure: average request rate and average bytes per response. If you have long
    lived connections or heavy TLS, include a peak scenario.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Validate with metrics when available</h2>
  <p>
    Once you can, use provider metrics for LCU/NLCU or the underlying drivers. Replace estimates with measured averages.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Use a calculator for scenarios</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-load-balancer-lcu-calculator/">ALB LCU / NLB NLCU calculator</a> to estimate units/hour
    from metrics, then use <a href="/calculators/aws-load-balancer-cost-calculator/">AWS Load Balancer Cost Calculator</a>{" "}
    to convert units/hour into dollars using your effective pricing.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
