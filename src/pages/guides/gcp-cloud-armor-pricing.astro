  <p>
    WAF cost estimation is a request-volume problem with a “tail risk”: attack spikes. A good estimate includes both a
    baseline month and an incident scenario.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Baseline request volume</h2>
  <p>
    Convert RPS to monthly requests. If your traffic is seasonal, model the high-traffic month rather than the average month.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS → monthly requests</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Attack scenario (spike budget)</h2>
  <p>
    Model a realistic incident: peak RPS × hours/days. This captures bot surges and DDoS windows. Without this, WAF costs can
    surprise you exactly when you’re under attack.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Logging and analytics</h2>
  <p>
    If you log every request during an incident, log ingestion can become a second spike driver. Model log ingestion and
    retention separately.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">Log ingestion</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/log-retention-storage-cost-calculator/">Retention</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak RPS from historical incidents or provider analytics (budget for the tail).</li>
    <li>Validate whether you log all requests or only blocked/sampled requests during incidents.</li>
    <li>Validate WAF placement (edge vs origin) to avoid double-counting request charges.</li>
  </ul>
