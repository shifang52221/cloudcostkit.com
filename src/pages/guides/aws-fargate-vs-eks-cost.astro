  <p>
    Fargate vs EKS cost is mostly a trade-off between <strong>pay-per-task</strong> and <strong>pay-per-node</strong>.
    Fargate charges the resources of running tasks; EKS usually means paying for a fleet of nodes (plus per-cluster
    overhead). This guide shows what typically decides the winner and how to compare consistently.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 0: normalize assumptions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Average compute demand</strong>: typical vCPU and memory used (not peak-only).</li>
    <li><strong>Burstiness</strong>: how often you hit peak and how quickly you scale down.</li>
    <li><strong>Service count</strong>: number of workloads sharing the platform (consolidation changes EKS economics).</li>
    <li><strong>Non-compute</strong>: load balancers, logs, and transfer baseline.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 1: model Fargate as vCPU/GB hours</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>vCPU-hours = avg running tasks × vCPU per task × hours/month</li>
    <li>GB-hours = avg running tasks × memory GB per task × hours/month</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 2: model EKS as nodes + fixed cluster overhead</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Control plane</strong>: fixed hourly fee per cluster (matters for many small clusters).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Nodes</strong>: node-hours driven by requests-based sizing, headroom, and imperfect packing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add-ons</strong>: ingress, logging, monitoring agents consume per-node resources and raise the baseline.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What usually decides the winner</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Workload consolidation</strong>: if many workloads share nodes efficiently, EKS often wins.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Burstiness and schedules</strong>: if workloads are spiky or scheduled, Fargate often wins by avoiding idle.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cluster sprawl</strong>: many EKS clusters amplify fixed fees and duplicate add-ons; Fargate avoids per-cluster overhead.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Headroom and fragmentation</strong>: strict topology rules, pod caps, and anti-affinity can force extra nodes on EKS.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Line items that dominate both (don’t skip)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Load balancers</strong>: count always-on LBs and capacity units.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs/metrics</strong>: ingestion GB/day, retention, and series growth (cardinality).</li>
    <li><strong>Networking</strong>: NAT processed GB, cross-AZ transfer, and internet egress.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing only compute and ignoring observability and networking lines.</li>
    <li>Assuming perfect EKS packing (real clusters need headroom and have fragmentation).</li>
    <li>Running many small EKS clusters for non-prod and paying fixed fees everywhere.</li>
    <li>Using peak task count for Fargate budgeting instead of average.</li>
    <li>Ignoring “one LB per service” as a baseline cost driver.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate after the first month</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare billed vCPU/GB hours (Fargate) or node-hours (EKS) to the model.</li>
    <li>Check whether average capacity matches assumptions (not just peak).</li>
    <li>Confirm the top 3 cost drivers and decide which lever to pull first.</li>
  </ul>
