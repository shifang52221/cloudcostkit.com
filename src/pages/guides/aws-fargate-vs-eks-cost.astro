  <p>
    The real question in “Fargate vs EKS cost” is usually: <strong>how much idle capacity do you pay for</strong>, and{" "}
    <strong>how much operational overhead do you want</strong>? Use the checklist below to compare apples-to-apples.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: normalize the workload</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Average running replicas/tasks over the month (not peak).</li>
    <li>Typical CPU and memory usage (not requests in a vacuum).</li>
    <li>Traffic shape: steady, bursty, or scheduled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: model compute</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fargate</strong>: vCPU-hours + memory GB-hours (tasks × size × hours).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>EKS</strong>: nodes × $/hour (from requests-based sizing) + control plane and add-ons.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 3: add the line items that dominate at scale</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers</strong>: multiple services behind ALBs/NLBs can drive a large baseline.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs and metrics</strong>: ingestion + retention (and scan/search) can exceed compute for noisy services.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Networking</strong>: NAT gateway processed traffic, internet egress, and cross-AZ transfer.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Practical guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with Fargate for speed/simplicity when the fleet is small or uncertain.</li>
    <li>Move high-throughput steady services to EKS when utilization and packing efficiency matter.</li>
    <li>Re-evaluate after measuring real average utilization and traffic; don’t decide from list prices alone.</li>
  </ul>
