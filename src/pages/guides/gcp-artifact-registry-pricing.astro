  <p>
    Registries are “store bits, move bits”. A reliable estimate separates storage (GB-month) from download volume and egress.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate GB-month from retention: average artifact size × number retained. If artifacts share layers (container images),
    storage is often less than “tags × size”, so validate with real usage stats when possible.

  </p>

  <h2>2) Downloads (pull volume)</h2>
  <p>
    Downloads scale with CI/CD and autoscaling. Model the top drivers explicitly (build pipelines, node churn, deploy
    frequency) rather than using one blended number.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Egress</h2>
  <p>
    Split egress by destination and validate whether cross-region downloads are frequent (multi-region clusters often cause
    this).
  </p>

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate retention and garbage collection (old layers can keep storage high).</li>
    <li>Validate download volume during peak build/deploy windows and cluster scale-outs.</li>
    <li>Validate cross-region patterns (multi-region setups can multiply transfer).</li>
  </ul>
