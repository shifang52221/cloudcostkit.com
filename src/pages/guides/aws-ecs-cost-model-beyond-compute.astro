  <p>
    ECS cost surprises usually happen when teams budget only for compute (EC2 instance-hours or Fargate vCPU/GB-hours).
    In real services, the big costs often come from <strong>load balancers</strong>, <strong>logs</strong>, and{" "}
    <strong>networking</strong>. Use this checklist to build a more accurate total cost model.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Compute (baseline)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ECS on Fargate</strong>: vCPU-hours + memory GB-hours (running tasks).</li>
    <li><strong>ECS on EC2</strong>: instance-hours (plus EBS if you attach volumes).</li>
    <li><strong>Idle capacity</strong>: the difference between peak and average matters more than list price.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>2) Load balancers (baseline + capacity)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hourly baseline per ALB/NLB.</li>
    <li>Capacity units driven by connections, throughput, and rule evaluations.</li>
    <li>Multiple quiet services can still create a large baseline if each has its own load balancer.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>3) Logs and metrics (often bigger than compute)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Log ingestion is proportional to request volume and verbosity.</li>
    <li>Retention creates a steady GB-month storage baseline.</li>
    <li>Query scan costs spike during incidents and heavy dashboards.</li>
    <li>Metrics costs grow with custom metric cardinality and dashboard polling.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>4) Networking (NAT, egress, cross-AZ)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>NAT gateway</strong>: hourly + GB processed can spike for fleets pulling images and package updates.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet egress</strong>: downloads, external APIs, public traffic.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-AZ transfer</strong>: chatty microservices and uneven target placement.</li>
  </ul>

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>
  </div>

  <h2>5) Storage (EBS and snapshots)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you run ECS on EC2 and attach volumes, include EBS GB-month and performance settings.</li>
    <li>Model snapshots separately: change rate × retention is the key driver.</li>
  </ul>

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/aws-ebs-snapshot-cost-calculator/">EBS snapshots</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/guides/aws-ebs-pricing/">EBS pricing</a>
  </div>

  <h2>6) Container registry behavior (ECR is not just storage)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Storage grows with retention and CI push frequency.</li>
    <li>Pull traffic spikes during cluster scaling and cold starts.</li>
    <li>Cross-region pulls and NAT paths can change transfer costs materially.</li>
  </ul>

    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/aws-ecr-cost-calculator/">ECR cost</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/guides/aws-ecr-pricing/">ECR pricing</a>
  </div>

  <h2>7) Put it together (sum line items)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick compute model (Fargate vs EC2) and estimate average monthly capacity.</li>
    <li>Add load balancer baseline and estimate capacity units.</li>
    <li>Add logs (ingestion + retention) and validate verbosity assumptions.</li>
    <li>Add networking (NAT/egress/cross-AZ) for the real traffic paths.</li>
    <li>Add storage (EBS + snapshots) and registry behavior (ECR storage + pulls) where relevant.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate average (not peak) running tasks/instances for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Validate log ingestion GB/day and retention settings for the service.</li>
    <li>Validate NAT processed GB and egress GB for the service traffic paths.</li>
    <li>Validate how many load balancers exist and whether they are “shared” or “one per service”.</li>
  </ul>
