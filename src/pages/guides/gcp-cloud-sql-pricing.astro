  <p>
    Cloud SQL cost is easiest to estimate when you treat it as "capacity + data": instance-hours for compute, GB-month for
    storage and backups, and a separate transfer line item when clients are cross-region or external.
  </p>

  <h2>0) What to measure (inputs you can actually validate)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Instance-hours</strong>: primary + HA + replicas (baseline and peak months).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage GB-month</strong>: average data + index size across the month.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backups/PITR</strong>: backup GB-month and retention settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer</strong>: outbound GB/month by destination (internet vs cross-region).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Compute: instance-hours (primary, HA, replicas)</h2>
  <p>
    Model each instance separately and keep baseline vs peak months distinct. If you run HA or read replicas, count them
    explicitly because they are provisioned capacity.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/compute-instance-cost-calculator/">Compute instance cost</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Baseline: steady traffic, normal query mix.</li>
    <li>Peak: batch jobs, migrations, index builds, incident retries.</li>
    <li>Headroom: avoid resizing churn by budgeting realistic peak capacity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Storage: average GB-month (data + indexes)</h2>
  <p>
    Use average GB-month rather than end-of-month size. For growing datasets, end-of-month overstates cost; for shrinking
    datasets, it understates cost.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">Database storage growth</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Track index overhead separately if possible; it is rarely zero.</li>
    <li>Include staging/non-prod copies if they persist long-term.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Backups and retention (quiet multiplier)</h2>
  <p>
    Backup retention is a multiplier: the longer you keep backups, the more backup GB-month accumulates even without traffic
    growth. Treat backup retention as its own control knob.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Write down retention windows (days/months) and any compliance requirements.</li>
    <li>Plan restore validation: a real drill often reveals that "restore" is not just a button.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Network transfer (cross-region and external clients)</h2>
  <p>
    Network cost shows up when clients are outside the region or when analytics jobs pull large result sets. Split transfer
    by destination and validate whether traffic is private or public.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">

  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Instance-hours</strong> = primary + HA + replicas (baseline + peak)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Primary storage</strong> = avg GB-month (data + indexes)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backup storage</strong> = backup GB-month (retention window)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress</strong> = outbound GB/month (split by destination)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Forgetting HA/replicas (capacity doubles before any traffic increase).</li>
    <li>Using end-of-month storage size instead of average GB-month (misstates cost for growing datasets).</li>
    <li>Long backup retention and PITR storage growing silently.</li>
    <li>Cross-region clients or large query exports creating surprise egress.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak CPU/memory/IO and the heaviest query patterns.</li>
    <li>Validate storage growth rate and index overhead.</li>
    <li>Validate backup retention and any PITR settings.</li>
    <li>Validate network paths (private vs public/cross-region) and billable transfer boundaries.</li>
  </ul>
