  <p>
    Cloud SQL cost is typically “capacity + data”. The safest estimate breaks it into compute, storage, and backup/retention,
    then validates peak usage and growth assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Compute (instance-hours)</h2>
  <p>
    Model baseline instance-hours per environment. If you run HA or read replicas, count them explicitly. For new workloads,
    model two scenarios: baseline and peak.
  </p>

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/compute-instance-cost-calculator/">Compute instance cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use average stored GB and model growth. If the dataset grows steadily, compute the monthly average rather than using
    end-of-month size.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">Database storage growth</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Backups and retention</h2>
  <p>
    Backup storage and retention can be a quiet driver. Model backup retention windows separately from primary storage, and
    validate PITR settings.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Network transfer</h2>
  <p>
    If your clients read cross-region or from the public internet, network transfer may be billed. Split transfer by
    destination and validate boundaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak CPU/memory/IO and plan headroom (avoid resizing churn).</li>
    <li>Validate storage growth rate and retention policies for backups/snapshots.</li>
    <li>Validate network paths (private vs public/cross-region) and billable transfer.</li>
  </ul>
