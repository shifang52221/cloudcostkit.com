  <p>
    VPC endpoints are a common way to reduce NAT Gateway traffic and keep AWS-service access private. Cost modeling is
    simple if you separate two concepts: <strong>endpoint-hours</strong> and <strong>data processed (GB)</strong>, plus
    any data transfer boundaries in your architecture.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model (interface vs gateway endpoints)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Interface endpoints</strong>: endpoint-hours (endpoints x AZs x hours) and sometimes a per-GB processing fee.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gateway endpoints</strong>: a different cost model depending on service; treat them separately.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer boundaries</strong>: cross-AZ/cross-region paths can create separate transfer line items.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    The same "private access" goal can be achieved with different endpoint types. Always model the endpoint line item and the transfer path together.
  </p>

  <h2>Interface vs gateway endpoints: decision points</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Interface endpoints</strong> (PrivateLink): great when you need private access to many AWS services, but they add endpoint-hours per AZ and can multiply quickly across environments.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gateway endpoints</strong>: a different mechanism with a different cost model. Treat them separately and verify which services in your architecture can use them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Path matters</strong>: if clients in one AZ consistently talk to endpoints in another AZ, you can introduce cross-AZ transfer even if the endpoint line item looks correct.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fast estimate (baseline + scenario)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-vpc-interface-endpoint-cost-calculator/">VPC Interface Endpoint Cost Calculator</a> for a
    first-pass estimate of endpoint-hours + per-GB processing.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Baseline: current NAT GB processed and current endpoint inventory (if any).
    </li>
    <li>
      Scenario: endpoints added + NAT traffic reduced + any expected cross-AZ path changes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint-hours</strong> = endpoints * AZs per endpoint * hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint GB processed</strong> = GB/month expected to flow through endpoints
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint cost</strong> = hourly baseline + per-GB processing (if applicable)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Quick sanity check: if you add many endpoints across 3 AZs, the hourly baseline can dominate even when GB processed is modest. Model the hours first, then refine GB.
  </p>

  <h2>NAT break-even checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How much NAT GB processed is actually AWS-service traffic that can move to endpoints?</li>
    <li>How many endpoints will you deploy (and in how many AZs) across prod/staging/dev?</li>
    <li>Will endpoint routing change traffic locality (cross-AZ) or keep it AZ-local?</li>
    <li>Do you need endpoints everywhere, or only in a subset of VPCs and accounts?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Forgetting that interface endpoints scale with the number of AZs you use.</li>
    <li>Moving traffic across AZs or regions and creating new transfer charges.</li>
    <li>Assuming endpoints replace NAT costs without validating the traffic mix.</li>
    <li>Counting endpoints once while they exist in multiple VPCs and environments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the pricing model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reconcile endpoint-hours in billing against endpoints * AZs * hours.</li>
    <li>Spot-check the top destinations and verify they are the services you intended to route through endpoints.</li>
    <li>After rollout, compare NAT GB processed and endpoint GB processed as a before/after sanity check.</li>
  </ul>
