  <p>
    VPC endpoints are a common way to reduce NAT Gateway traffic and keep AWS-service access private. Cost modeling is
    simple if you separate two concepts: <strong>endpoint-hours</strong> and <strong>data processed (GB)</strong>, plus
    any data transfer boundaries in your architecture.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Interface endpoints</strong>: endpoint-hours (endpoints x AZs x hours) and sometimes a per-GB processing fee.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gateway endpoints</strong>: a different cost model depending on service; treat them separately.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer boundaries</strong>: cross-AZ/cross-region paths can create separate transfer line items.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-vpc-interface-endpoint-cost-calculator/">VPC Interface Endpoint Cost Calculator</a> for a
    first-pass estimate of endpoint-hours + per-GB processing.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Forgetting that interface endpoints scale with the number of AZs you use.</li>
    <li>Moving traffic across AZs or regions and creating new transfer charges.</li>
    <li>Assuming endpoints replace NAT costs without validating the traffic mix.</li>
  </ul>
