  <p>
    "Copying data" in cloud storage can mean many things: an intra-region copy, cross-region replication, backup copy
    traffic, or syncing objects between buckets. The costs usually fall into a few predictable buckets. This guide gives
    you a checklist so you don't miss a line item.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Transfer / data movement</h2>
  <p>
    If your copy moves data across regions (or out of a provider), you may pay a per-GB transfer fee. Sometimes a
    replication feature has its own per-GB charge, sometimes it's billed as cross-region transfer, and sometimes it's
    both.
  </p>
  <p>
    Estimate the GB/month that actually changes and gets copied. For most workloads, copy volume is driven by writes and
    churn, not the total dataset size.

    <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">Cross-region transfer cost</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're specifically pricing S3 replication, start with <a href="/guides/s3-replication-cost/">S3 replication cost</a>
    and treat replicated GB/month as the key input.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Extra storage at the destination</h2>
  <p>
    A copy or replica usually means you're storing the data twice. Destination storage is often the largest hidden cost
    because it's continuous (GB-month), even if the copy job runs once.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object storage cost</a> (add the replica stored GB as another
    line item).
  </p>

  <h2>3) Request fees (PUT/GET/LIST) can matter</h2>
  <p>
    Copy and replication workflows can increase request volume (PUT/COPY, GET, LIST, HEAD). For large objects with few
    operations, requests are often negligible; for millions of small objects, requests can become material.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/s3-request-cost-calculator/">S3 request cost</a> and{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">object storage cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Egress (when copying feeds another system)</h2>
  <p>
    If copy is part of a pipeline (for example, copy from storage into analytics, or into another cloud), egress pricing
    may dominate. Model it explicitly if you expect significant downloads.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data egress cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5) A quick way to estimate copied GB/month</h2>
  <p>
    If you don't know copy volume, start from write throughput (GB/day) or batch sizes (GB/job). Multiply by days/jobs
    per month. For change-heavy datasets, copy volume is usually closer to writes than total stored GB.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How many GB/month are copied (changed data), not total stored GB?</li>
    <li>Is there a per-GB replication feature fee?</li>
    <li>Is there cross-region transfer pricing in addition to feature fees?</li>
    <li>How much extra storage is held at the destination (and for how long)?</li>
    <li>Are request fees material (many small objects)?</li>
    <li>Is there egress out of storage to another service/provider?</li>
  </ul>
