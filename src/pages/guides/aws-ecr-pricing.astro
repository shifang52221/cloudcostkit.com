  <p>
    ECR costs are easiest to estimate with a two-part model: <strong>storage (GB-month)</strong> plus <strong>data
    transfer</strong>. The right answer depends heavily on your retention policy and where your workloads run.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Stored GB-month</strong>: average stored image size over the month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress GB/month</strong>: bytes pulled across billable network paths
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operational drivers</strong>: rebuild frequency, tag retention, and multi-arch duplication
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-ecr-cost-calculator/">AWS ECR Cost Calculator</a> for a simple storage + transfer model.
    Then refine egress based on where your clusters run and whether you replicate images across regions.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate storage with a few representative repos (average image size and retention window).</li>
    <li>Validate transfer boundary: same region vs cross-region vs internet makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li>Watch for spike drivers: CI rebuild frequency and multi-arch duplication.</li>
  </ul>
