  <p>
    ECR costs are easiest to estimate with a two-part model: <strong>storage (GB-month)</strong> plus{" "}
    <strong>transfer</strong>. The right answer depends heavily on your retention policy and where your workloads run
    (same region vs cross-region vs internet).
  </p>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month): how many images you keep</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Storage grows with tags retained and average image size, not with how often you deploy.
    </li>
    <li>
      CI pipelines that push many tags/day create fast growth without retention policies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Multi-arch images can duplicate stored bytes if you keep separate variants per architecture.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>2) Transfer: where pulls happen matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Pulls in the <strong>same region</strong> are usually cheaper than cross-region pulls.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cross-region replication can reduce pull transfer but increases storage (you store multiple copies).
    </li>
    <li>
      Internet paths and NAT gateways can add additional cost layers in real architectures.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you use private subnets, include NAT gateway processed GB as a separate line item.
  </p>

  <h2>A fast estimation workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Estimate storage: average image size × retained images (by repo class).</li>
    <li>Estimate pull volume: pulls/day × average image size (and cache hit behavior).</li>
    <li>Apply your effective $/GB-month and $/GB transfer for the actual traffic path.</li>
    <li>Validate with a real week of pull patterns (CI + cluster autoscaling days).</li>
  </ol>

  </div>

  <h2>Common spike drivers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>No retention</strong>: old tags accumulate forever.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Frequent rebuilds</strong>: pushing many images/day grows storage quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cluster scaling</strong>: new nodes pull images repeatedly (cold cache).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-region pulls</strong>: replication and multi-region clusters change transfer costs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate pull transfer (fast model)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Pull GB/day ~= (pulls/day) × (avg image size GB) × (1 - cache hit rate)
    </li>
    <li>
      If nodes re-pull on every deploy, your effective cache hit rate can be near zero during busy windows.
    </li>
    <li>
      Include CI separately: CI often pulls more frequently than production.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Transfer is a boundary problem. If your pulls go through NAT or cross-region, model those paths explicitly.
  </p>

  <h2>Retention policy vs rollback needs (practical)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>CI tags: keep a short window (days) and rely on rebuildability.</li>
    <li>Release tags: keep a longer window (weeks/months) for rollbacks.</li>
    <li>Base images: pin carefully; a few large images can dominate storage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate storage with a few representative repos (image size and retention window).</li>
    <li>Validate transfer boundary: same region vs cross-region vs internet makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li>Validate pull behavior during autoscaling and CI bursts (not just steady state).</li>
  </ul>
