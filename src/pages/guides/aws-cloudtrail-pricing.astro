  <p>
    CloudTrail estimates are easiest when you split <strong>event volume</strong> by type and then apply your effective
    per-event pricing. The single most important split is <strong>management vs data events</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>CloudTrail pricing inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Management events</strong>: baseline event volume.</li>
    <li><strong>Data events</strong>: S3/Lambda events per resource.</li>
    <li><strong>Insights</strong>: anomaly detection add-on if enabled.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Management events</strong>: control-plane actions (API calls that create/modify resources)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data events</strong>: high-volume data-plane operations (can grow rapidly)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Insights events</strong> (if enabled): additional detections with their own pricing model
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Downstream</strong>: storage + query + external ingest costs (S3/Athena/SIEM/CloudWatch)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Before pricing: define scope (this changes everything)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Accounts and regions</strong>: multi-account footprints multiply audit volume and downstream storage.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data event resources</strong>: which buckets/prefixes/functions are in scope (avoid "all resources" defaults).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retention expectations</strong>: how long you keep raw logs vs derived signals.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you are doing a budget for the first time, start with a narrow scope and expand with measurement.
  </p>

  <h2>A fast estimation workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Estimate events/month</strong> for each bucket (management, data, insights).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Apply region pricing</strong> to each bucket (use official pricing for your region).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add downstream costs</strong>: storage retention and query scans (often larger than expected).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="muted">

  </p>

  <h2>Downstream costs (frequently larger than expected)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>S3 storage</strong>: retained GB-month based on retention days and compression.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Query/scan</strong>: Athena or log platform scans (GB scanned per query * query frequency).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>SIEM ingestion</strong>: forwarding everything into an expensive tool often dominates the total.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Copies and pipelines</strong>: replicated buckets, multiple destinations, and cross-account aggregation add storage and query duplication.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enabling data events broadly without a volume estimate (volume can be orders of magnitude higher).</li>
    <li>Forgetting automation and retries (deploys and incidents inflate event counts).</li>
    <li>Ignoring downstream costs (S3 retention, Athena scans, SIEM ingestion).</li>
    <li>Mixing environments/accounts in one estimate when governance differs.</li>
    <li>Building dashboards that scan months of logs when a day-level query would answer the question.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure event counts for at least 7 days and split by management vs data vs insight.</li>
    <li>Confirm which resources and event types are included in your selectors.</li>
    <li>Measure query scan sizes using your real investigations and dashboards.</li>
    <li>Confirm retention and lifecycle policies (including any replicated copies).</li>
  </ul>
