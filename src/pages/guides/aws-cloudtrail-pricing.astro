  <p>
    CloudTrail-style costs are easiest to estimate when you separate <strong>event volume</strong> by type and then apply
    your effective per-event pricing. The most important split is management vs data events.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Management events</strong>: control-plane actions (API calls that create/modify resources)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data events</strong>: high-volume data-plane operations (can grow rapidly)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Insights events</strong> (if enabled): additional detection signals with their own pricing
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Downstream</strong>: storage + query + external ingest costs
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-cloudtrail-cost-calculator/">AWS CloudTrail Cost Calculator</a> for a quick event-only
    estimate, then add downstream storage/analysis and any security tool ingestion.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enabling data events broadly without a volume estimate.</li>
    <li>Retry storms and automated tooling inflating API call volume.</li>
    <li>Forgetting downstream costs (S3 storage, Athena queries, SIEM ingestion).</li>
  </ul>
