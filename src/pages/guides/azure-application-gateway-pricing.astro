  <p>
    L7 gateway bills usually scale with <strong>time</strong>, <strong>traffic processed</strong>, and sometimes <strong>requests</strong>.
    The main mistake is to budget only "one gateway" without modeling traffic and log volume (or missing peak windows).
  </p>

  <h2>Application Gateway pricing inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gateway hours</strong>: base hourly charges.</li>
    <li><strong>Capacity units</strong>: throughput and new connections.</li>
    <li><strong>Data processed</strong>: GB/month through the gateway.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>0) Define the gateway scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Environments</strong>: prod + staging + dev (hours multiply quickly).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Public vs private</strong>: internet-facing gateways often have meaningful egress and WAF/log exposure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline vs peak</strong>: gateways are designed for peaks; cost and reliability both depend on peak behavior.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Time (gateway-hours)</h2>
  <p>
    Start with the number of gateways and hours per month. If you run multiple regions or multiple environments, model them
    separately.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Requests and response sizes (traffic processed)</h2>
  <p>
    Request volume and response sizes determine traffic processed. If you only know RPS, convert to monthly requests, then
    estimate average response size to get GB/month.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Data transfer (egress)</h2>
  <p>
    If the gateway sends data to the internet, outbound transfer is often billed separately and can dominate cost for
    high-bandwidth apps. Keep CDN bandwidth separate from origin egress if you front the gateway with a CDN.

  </p>

  <h2>4) WAF and logging (the "second bill")</h2>
  <p>
    If WAF and access logs are enabled, model them separately. WAF is request-driven; logs are volume-driven (GB ingested +
    retention + query scans). During incidents, both can spike.

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Gateway baseline</strong> = gateways * hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong> = baseline + peak (include retries)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GB/month</strong> = requests/month * avg response size (GB)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong> = (bytes/request) * requests/month + retention + query scans
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimating only average traffic and missing peak spikes (deploys, incidents, bots).</li>
    <li>Ignoring retry storms that multiply requests and logs.</li>
    <li>Double-counting CDN bandwidth and origin egress as the same GB.</li>
    <li>Turning on verbose access logs without retention and sampling guardrails.</li>
    <li>Budgeting prod only and forgetting staging/dev gateways.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak vs average RPS/GB (capacity and cost depend on peaks).</li>
    <li>Validate response sizes by sampling your largest endpoints separately.</li>
    <li>Confirm whether WAF and access logs are enabled and what retention window applies.</li>
  </ul>
