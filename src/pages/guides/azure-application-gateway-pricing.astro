  <p>
    L7 load balancer bills usually scale with <strong>time</strong>, <strong>traffic processed</strong>, and sometimes
    <strong>requests</strong>. The main mistake is to estimate only “one gateway” without modeling traffic and log volume.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Time (gateway-hours)</h2>
  <p>
    Start with the number of gateways and hours per month. If you run multiple environments (dev/stage/prod), model them
    separately.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Requests and response sizes</h2>
  <p>
    Request volume and response sizes determine traffic processed. If you know only RPS, convert to monthly requests, then
    estimate average response size to get GB transferred.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Data transfer (egress)</h2>
  <p>
    If the gateway sends data to the internet, outbound transfer is often billed separately and can dominate cost for
    high-bandwidth apps.

  </p>

  <h2>4) WAF and logging</h2>
  <p>
    If WAF and access logs are enabled, model them separately. WAF is request-driven; logs are volume-driven (GB ingested +
    retention).
  </p>

    <a href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">Log cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak vs average RPS/GB (capacity and scaling depend on peaks).</li>
    <li>Validate retry/timeout patterns that multiply requests and traffic processed.</li>
    <li>Validate whether WAF and access logs are enabled and what retention window applies.</li>
  </ul>
