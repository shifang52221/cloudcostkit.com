  <p>
    The best way to compare EKS vs GKE vs AKS cost is to normalize capacity first (node count) and then add the costs that
    live "around the cluster": load balancers, egress/NAT, storage, and observability. This avoids apples-vs-oranges
    comparisons like "node price only".
  </p>

  <h2>0) Start with the same line items (for every provider)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Worker nodes</strong>: node count × $/hour × billable hours (baseline + peak).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Control plane</strong>: fixed fees, multi-cluster strategy, and management overhead.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers / ingress</strong>: hourly + data processing charges depending on product.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong>: volumes, snapshots, object storage, and growth over time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Observability</strong>: logs ingestion/retention, metrics series, and scan/query.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress</strong>: internet egress, NAT, and cross-zone/region transfer legs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Normalize capacity (node count) from workload requests</h2>
  <p>
    Start from pod requests/limits and a realistic allocatable headroom. Do not size from "average CPU" alone; Kubernetes
    is constrained by bin packing, headroom, and spikes.

    <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-cost-calculator/">Cluster cost</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Build two scenarios: <strong>average month</strong> and <strong>peak month</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you run autoscaling, model the fraction of time you are at peak (peaks are rarely 24/7).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Normalize pricing (effective $/hour)</h2>
  <p>
    Use an effective blended $/hour that matches your plan: on-demand, commitments, spot mix, and discounts. Early-stage
    models should prioritize being directionally correct over being SKU-perfect.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Add the "around the cluster" costs (where winners change)</h2>
  <p>
    Many teams discover that node price is not the deciding factor. These line items often dominate once traffic grows.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers</strong>: hourly + data processing; traffic-heavy services pay more here than expected.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT/egress</strong>: chatty microservices and cross-zone patterns create hidden transfer legs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Observability</strong>: logs and metrics scale with traffic and retention, not with node count.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong>: persistent volumes, snapshots, and growth are long-lived multipliers.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>4) Worksheet template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Nodes</strong> = baseline nodes + peak nodes (and % of time at peak)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Control plane</strong> = fixed monthly fee (multiply by number of clusters)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Load balancers</strong> = count × hours + data processed (if applicable)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress</strong> = GB/month by destination (internet, cross-region)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong> = GB/day ingestion + retention days + scans
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Metrics</strong> = active series × sample rate × retention
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing only node price and ignoring control plane + "around the cluster" costs.</li>
    <li>Using peak node count 24/7 when autoscaling is bursty (overstates cost).</li>
    <li>Ignoring egress and NAT: chatty services pay for transfer legs.</li>
    <li>Letting observability grow unbounded (logs retention drift, high-cardinality metrics).</li>
    <li>Not validating with a representative week (good-day data is not enough).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate allocatable headroom and bin packing (do pods actually fit the way you think?).</li>
    <li>Validate autoscaling patterns: how often are you at peak?</li>
    <li>Validate egress by destination and identify the top talkers.</li>
    <li>Validate log ingestion and retention; estimate scans from dashboard/alert frequency.</li>
  </ul>
