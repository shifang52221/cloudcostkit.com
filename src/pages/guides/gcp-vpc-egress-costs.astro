  <p>
    Transfer costs are easiest to control when you split traffic into billable categories and validate boundaries. This guide
    is a practical workflow you can apply before you deploy or when you see an unexpected bill.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Why egress bills surprise teams</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Distributed systems create cross-zone and cross-region traffic that is invisible from app-level metrics.</li>
    <li>Retries/timeouts multiply payload transfer during incidents.</li>
    <li>CDN usage changes the shape of origin egress vs edge bandwidth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Split traffic into destinations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Internet egress (end users, SaaS, third-party APIs)</li>
    <li>Inter-region (replication, DR, multi-region services)</li>
    <li>Inter-zone (east-west traffic in multi-zone systems)</li>
    <li>Origin egress to CDN (cache fill)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Convert usage to GB/month</h2>
  <p>
    Use a representative time window and convert to monthly GB. If you only have RPS, multiply by average response size to
    approximate transfer volume.

    <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Split heavy endpoints (downloads/exports) so they do not disappear into one average.</li>
    <li>Keep baseline vs peak months separate (incident retry storms are a real multiplier).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Apply effective blended rates for planning</h2>
  <p>
    For early budgeting, a blended effective rate per GB is fine. The real value is the breakdown: it tells you what to
    cache, compress, co-locate, or route differently.

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet egress GB/month</strong> = end-user + third-party APIs (baseline + peak)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inter-zone GB/month</strong> = top east-west flows (LB, service mesh, database calls)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inter-region GB/month</strong> = replication + DR + multi-region reads
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CDN origin GB/month</strong> = cache fill traffic (separate from edge bandwidth)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Optimization levers (match the lever to the destination)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Internet: CDN, compression, reduce payload size, avoid heavy-tail endpoints.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inter-zone: co-locate chatty services, reduce retries, batch calls, cache responses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inter-region: reduce cross-region reads, use regional affinity, validate replication topology.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Not splitting by destination (optimizations become guesswork).</li>
    <li>Double-counting CDN edge bandwidth and origin egress.</li>
    <li>Using one average response size and missing heavy endpoints.</li>
    <li>Not modeling incident retry storms (peaks are not averages).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate cross-zone and cross-region traffic (common hidden drivers).</li>
    <li>Validate compression and payload sizes for high-volume endpoints.</li>
    <li>Validate CDN origin egress separately from edge bandwidth and cache hit rate.</li>
  </ul>
