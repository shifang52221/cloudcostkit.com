  <p>
    Transfer costs are easiest to control when you split traffic into billable categories and validate boundaries. This guide
    is a practical workflow you can apply before you deploy or when you see an unexpected bill.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Split traffic into destinations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Internet egress (end users, SaaS, third-party APIs)</li>
    <li>Cross-region (replication, DR, multi-region services)</li>
    <li>Cross-zone / inter-zone (distributed services)</li>
    <li>Origin egress to CDN (cache fill)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Convert usage to GB/month</h2>
  <p>
    Use a representative time window and convert to monthly GB. If you only have RPS, multiply by average response size to
    approximate transfer volume.

    <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS → requests</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Apply effective blended rates for planning</h2>
  <p>
    For early budgeting, a blended effective rate per GB is fine. The real value is the breakdown: it tells you what to
    cache, compress, or route differently.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate cross-zone and cross-region traffic from distributed systems (common hidden drivers).</li>
    <li>Validate compression and payload sizes for high-volume endpoints.</li>
    <li>Validate CDN origin egress separately from edge bandwidth and cache hit rate.</li>
  </ul>
