      q: "How do I reduce KMS calls without weakening security?",

  <p>
    Most KMS savings come from reducing <strong>requests</strong> without breaking security guarantees. Treat big KMS request
    spikes as both a cost issue and a reliability signal.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce KMS calls in hot paths</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid decrypting secrets on every request; prefer short-lived caching where safe.</li>
    <li>Use envelope encryption so bulk data encryption happens locally after a data key is generated.</li>
    <li>Don’t re-encrypt or rotate more frequently than required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Fix retry loops</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Time-outs and transient errors can cause retry storms and multiply KMS calls.</li>
    <li>Add backoff and circuit breakers to protect both cost and reliability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce key sprawl</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use fewer keys when separate keys don’t add meaningful isolation.</li>
    <li>Retire unused keys from old environments and test accounts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify changes</h2>

    requests/month.
