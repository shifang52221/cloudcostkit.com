    Most KMS savings come from reducing requests without breaking security guarantees. Treat large KMS request spikes as
    both a cost issue and a reliability signal.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce KMS calls in hot paths</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid decrypting secrets on every request; prefer short-lived caching where safe.</li>
    <li>Use envelope encryption so bulk data encryption happens locally after a data key is generated.</li>
    <li>Do not rotate/re-encrypt more frequently than required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Fix retry loops</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Timeouts and transient errors can cause retry storms and multiply KMS calls.</li>
    <li>Add backoff and circuit breakers to protect both cost and reliability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce key sprawl</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use fewer keys when separate keys do not add meaningful isolation.</li>
    <li>Retire unused keys from old environments and test accounts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure requests/day for a representative week (avoid incident spikes).</li>
    <li>Confirm which callers generate requests (apps, secrets, storage, databases).</li>
    <li>After changes, validate rotation and access policies still meet security requirements.</li>
  </ul>
