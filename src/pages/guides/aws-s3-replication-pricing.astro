  <p>
    The biggest input in S3 replication pricing is <strong>replicated GB/month</strong>. That volume is driven by writes
    and churn, not by total stored data.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Estimate replication volume from writes</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/guides/estimate-replication-gb-per-month-from-writes/">this guide</a> to estimate replicated GB/month
    from GB/day writes or PUT counts and object size.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Price the per-GB replication line item</h2>
  <p>
    Use a per-GB assumption that matches your plan (feature fee, transfer-like pricing, or both):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/calculators/s3-replication-cost-calculator/">S3 replication cost calculator</a></li>
    <li><a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">Cross-region transfer cost</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Don't forget destination storage</h2>
  <p>
    Replication typically means storing the data twice. Add destination storage as a separate line item using{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">object storage cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) CRR vs SRR: when the option changes cost</h2>
  <p>
    If you're deciding between cross-region replication (CRR) and same-region replication (SRR), use this checklist:{" "}
    <a href="/guides/s3-crr-vs-srr-cost/">S3 CRR vs SRR cost</a>.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate which boundary is billed: storage, requests, egress, replication, retrieval.</li>
    <li>Separate CDN bandwidth from origin egress (cache fill) when using a CDN.</li>
    <li>Validate units (GB vs GiB) and request units (per 1k/10k/1M).</li>
  </ul>
