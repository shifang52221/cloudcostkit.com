  <p>
    The biggest input in S3 replication pricing is <strong>replicated GB/month</strong>. That volume is driven by writes
    and churn, not by total stored data.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model (replication is not one number)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Replicated GB/month</strong>: changed data replicated (steady-state driver)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>One-time backfill</strong>: initial copy of existing objects (migration/enablement event)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Destination storage</strong>: replica storage GB-month (often the largest ongoing cost)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Request overhead</strong>: extra PUT/COPY/LIST and control-plane activity can show up for high-churn buckets
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Region boundary</strong>: CRR can introduce transfer-like costs compared to SRR
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Estimate replication volume from writes (steady-state)</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/guides/estimate-replication-gb-per-month-from-writes/">this guide</a> to estimate replicated GB/month
    from GB/day writes or PUT counts and object size.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Replication volume tracks <strong>changed bytes</strong>. If your workload rewrites objects often (churn), replicated GB/month can be much larger than "new data added".
  </p>

  <h2>2) Price the per-GB replication line item (and keep backfill separate)</h2>
  <p>
    Use a per-GB assumption that matches your plan (feature fee, transfer-like pricing, or both):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/calculators/s3-replication-cost-calculator/">S3 replication cost calculator</a></li>
    <li><a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">Cross-region transfer cost</a></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create a <strong>backfill scenario</strong> for the initial copy (bucket size at enablement time).
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a <strong>steady-state scenario</strong> for replicated GB/month from writes/churn.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Don't forget destination storage</h2>
  <p>
    Replication typically means storing the data twice. Add destination storage as a separate line item using{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">object storage cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) CRR vs SRR: when the option changes cost</h2>
  <p>
    If you're deciding between cross-region replication (CRR) and same-region replication (SRR), use this checklist:{" "}
    <a href="/guides/s3-crr-vs-srr-cost/">S3 CRR vs SRR cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using total bucket size as the monthly replication input (unless you are modeling a one-time backfill).</li>
    <li>Missing churn: frequent overwrites and deletes create replicated bytes that do not show up as "growth".</li>
    <li>Forgetting destination storage GB-month (replication is usually double storage).</li>
    <li>Not separating CRR transfer-like effects from SRR.</li>
    <li>Assuming replication is "free" operationally: backlog and retries during incidents can create peaks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>After enablement, reconcile replicated bytes and replica storage in CUR/Cost Explorer.</li>
    <li>Validate replication volume by sampling writes/day and object sizes for a representative week.</li>
    <li>Track one-time events separately (backfills, migrations, reprocessing).</li>
  </ul>
