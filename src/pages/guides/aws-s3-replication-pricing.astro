  <p>
    The biggest input in S3 replication pricing is <strong>replicated GB/month</strong>. That volume is driven by writes
    and churn, not by total stored data.
  </p>

  <h2>Estimate replication volume from writes</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/guides/estimate-replication-gb-per-month-from-writes/">this guide</a> to estimate replicated GB/month
    from GB/day writes or PUT counts and object size.
  </p>

  <h2>Don’t forget destination storage</h2>
  <p>
    Replication typically means storing the data twice. Add destination storage as a separate line item using
    <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object storage cost</a>.
