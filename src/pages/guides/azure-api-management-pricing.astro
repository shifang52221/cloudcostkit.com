  <p>
    API Management pricing is easiest to estimate with a driver model: <strong>requests</strong>, <strong>transfer</strong>,
    and <strong>logs</strong>. Underestimates usually come from retry storms, large payloads, or unbounded access logs.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Requests (per month)</h2>
  <p>
    Start from RPS, convert to monthly requests, then split by endpoint group if you have a large range of response sizes
    (e.g., “small JSON” vs “large exports”).

  </p>

  <h2>2) Response transfer (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate transfer from response size and request volume. If you front your APIs with a CDN, keep CDN edge bandwidth
    separate from origin egress and avoid double-counting.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Logs and observability</h2>
  <p>
    Access logs and application logs scale with requests. A simple estimate is:
    <strong>bytes logged per request × monthly requests</strong>. If you store logs for weeks, retention can become a large
    secondary driver.

    <a href="/calculators/log-retention-storage-cost-calculator/">Retention storage</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate retry rates and timeouts (retries multiply requests, transfer, and logs).</li>
    <li>Validate average response size using real traffic samples (model “big endpoints” separately).</li>
    <li>Validate log bytes/request and retention window (don’t assume “logs are small”).</li>
  </ul>
