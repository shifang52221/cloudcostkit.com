    Alarm charges are usually linear in alarm count. The best savings come from controlling alarm sprawl, especially
    across environments and auto-scaled resources.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce duplicates and dead alarms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete alarms for retired services and old environments.</li>
    <li>Remove duplicate alarms across regions/accounts unless they add value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Avoid per-entity alarms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer SLO-based alarms over per-pod/per-tenant alarms where possible.</li>
    <li>Aggregate metrics before alarming (for example, fleet-level error rate).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Right-size high-resolution usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Downgrade high-resolution alarms that don't need fast evaluation.</li>
    <li>Use composite alarms to reduce alert noise (and model their cost).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Inventory alarm count by environment and type (standard vs high-resolution vs composite).</li>
    <li>Remove duplicates, then validate incident coverage against core SLOs.</li>
    <li>Track noise: alert frequency and false positives should go down after consolidation.</li>
  </ul>
