  <p>
    Alarm charges are usually linear in <strong>alarm count</strong>. The best savings come from controlling alarm
    sprawl, especially across environments and auto-scaled resources.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce duplicates and dead alarms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete alarms for retired services and old environments.</li>
    <li>Remove duplicate alarms across regions/accounts unless they add value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Avoid per-entity alarms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer SLO-based alarms over per-pod/per-tenant alarms where possible.</li>
    <li>Aggregate metrics before alarming (e.g., fleet-level error rate).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Right-size high-resolution usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Downgrade high-resolution alarms that don’t need fast evaluation.</li>
    <li>Use composite alarms to reduce alert noise (but model their own cost).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantify the impact</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-cloudwatch-alarms-cost-calculator/">CloudWatch Alarms Cost Calculator</a> to estimate
    savings from reducing alarm count or high-resolution usage.
