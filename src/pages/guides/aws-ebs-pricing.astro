  <p class="muted">
    EBS cost estimates usually go wrong for two reasons: (1) mixing up volume storage vs snapshots, and (2) forgetting
    performance charges when your volume type bills for IOPS/throughput.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Start with storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use the average allocated volume size (or average used if your billing model differs) and multiply by $/GB-month for
    your region and volume type.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Add performance charges only if they apply</h2>
  <p>
    Some volume types include baseline performance and do not bill separately for IOPS/throughput. Others allow
    provisioning performance with additional charges. If you’re unsure, model two scenarios: “storage-only” and
    “storage + provisioned performance”.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Model snapshots separately</h2>
  <p>
    Snapshot retention and churn can create meaningful recurring storage spend. If you take frequent snapshots or keep
    long retention, add a separate snapshot GB-month line item.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Use a calculator for scenarios</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-ebs-cost-calculator/">AWS EBS Cost Calculator</a> to estimate storage + optional
    performance charges using your effective pricing inputs.
