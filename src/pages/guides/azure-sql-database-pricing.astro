  <p>
    Managed database cost is usually “capacity + data”. The safest estimate breaks the database into compute, storage, and
    backup/retention, and then validates IO and growth assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Compute baseline</h2>
  <p>
    Pick an initial capacity based on expected concurrency and query patterns, then plan for headroom. If the workload is
    spiky, model peak periods separately (peak hours drive the right sizing).
  </p>

  <h2>2) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use average stored GB. If the dataset is growing, estimate monthly growth and compute average size across the month.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Backups and retention</h2>
  <p>
    Backup retention is often a quiet cost driver. Model backup storage separately from primary storage, and validate
    retention windows (PITR, snapshots, long-term retention).
  </p>

  <h2>4) Networking</h2>
  <p>
    If clients access the database cross-zone/region or from the public internet, network transfer may be billed. Split
    transfer by destination and validate boundaries.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak CPU/memory/IO and plan headroom (avoid resizing churn).</li>
    <li>Validate storage growth and retention policy for backups/snapshots.</li>
    <li>Validate network paths (private access vs public/cross-region) and billable transfer.</li>
  </ul>
