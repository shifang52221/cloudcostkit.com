    q: "What’s a safer utilization target?",

  <p class="muted">
    ECS autoscaling should reduce cost by matching capacity to demand. In practice, teams often see higher bills because
    scaling is noisy, retries multiply traffic, and non-compute line items grow with volume.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Noisy signals cause oscillation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>CPU% can spike briefly (GC, cold caches, bursty traffic) and trigger scale-out.</li>
    <li>If scale-in is slow or cautious, you spend long periods above average.</li>
    <li>Use smoothing/windows and validate target utilization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Retries multiply traffic (and cost)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Retries increase request volume, logs, and sometimes egress/NAT.</li>
    <li>Timeouts and backoff matter as much as scaling rules.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Hidden line items scale with traffic</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion grows with request volume and verbosity.</li>
    <li><strong>NAT/egress</strong>: external calls and downloads can spike costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Load balancers</strong>: capacity units can increase with connections and throughput.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Validate task sizing</h2>
  <p>
    Over-sized tasks keep cost high even when scaling works. Use a sizing calculator and target utilization.
