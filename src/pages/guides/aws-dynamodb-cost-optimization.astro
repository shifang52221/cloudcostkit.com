    DynamoDB costs are usually controllable. The key is to focus on the levers that move the bill: request volume, item
    size, and storage growth.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Reduce request volume (especially reads)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cache hot reads where correctness allows.</li>
    <li>Batch reads/writes when you can.</li>
    <li>Fix retry loops (timeouts and throttling) that multiply requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Reduce item size and payloads</h2>
  <p>
    Large items increase read/write work and increase storage. Review item schemas and avoid storing duplicated large
    blobs inside table items.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Avoid hot partitions</h2>
  <p>
    Uneven access patterns cause throttling which can trigger retries and inflate costs. If you see throttles, treat it
    as both a performance and cost bug.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Control storage and retention</h2>
  <p>
    If the dataset grows steadily, forecast cost with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">Database Storage Growth Calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Sanity-check with a simple calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-dynamodb-cost-calculator/">AWS DynamoDB Cost Calculator</a> to see whether reads, writes,
    or storage is your dominant driver, then optimize the right lever.
