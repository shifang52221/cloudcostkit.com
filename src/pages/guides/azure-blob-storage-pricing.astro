  <p>
    Blob Storage looks simple on the surface (GB-month), but real bills usually include multiple drivers: operations,
    redundancy/replication, and <strong>data transfer</strong>. This guide is a practical model you can apply to a new
    workload or to sanity-check an existing bill.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use average stored GB over the month (GB-month). If the dataset is growing, average is more accurate than end-of-month
    size. Split by tier (hot/cool/archive) if you know the mix.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>2) Operations (reads/writes/list)</h2>
  <p>
    Operations matter when you have lots of small objects and high request volume (APIs, thumbnails, telemetry archives).
    For large-object workloads, operations are often second-order.
  </p>

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/api-request-cost-calculator/">API request cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Redundancy and replication</h2>
  <p>
    Redundancy choices (e.g., zone-redundant or geo-redundant strategies) can affect both storage and transfer. Treat
    replication as its own line: replicated GB-month and replicated GB transferred.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/storage-replication-cost-calculator/">Storage replication cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Retrieval and data movement</h2>
  <p>
    For colder tiers and archived data, retrieval and early-deletion rules can be a hidden cost driver. Separately model:
    retrieval GB, retrieval requests, and any minimum storage duration penalties.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tip: if you restore frequently (weekly workflows, audits, reprocessing), you may not be an archive workload. Model a baseline month and a peak month explicitly.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Egress (outbound bandwidth)</h2>
  <p>
    Outbound data transfer is frequently the surprise line item. Split egress into at least: <strong>to the internet</strong>,
    <strong>to CDN</strong>, and <strong>cross-region</strong> (if applicable). If you front storage with a CDN, distinguish
    CDN edge bandwidth from origin egress (cache fill).
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data egress cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Decision checklist (tiers and redundancy)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Access pattern</strong>: hot vs cool vs archive depends on read frequency and restore SLA.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Object size</strong>: many small objects increase operation costs and operational overhead.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Redundancy</strong>: replication choices affect both storage and transfer. Treat them as separate line items.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Delivery path</strong>: CDN bandwidth and origin egress are different GB; do not double-count.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong> = average GB-month (split hot/cool/archive)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operations</strong> = read ops + write ops (split by request class if needed)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Replication</strong> = replicated GB-month + replicated GB transferred
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer</strong> = internet egress + CDN origin egress + cross-region (modeled separately)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using end-of-month storage size instead of average GB-month.</li>
    <li>Ignoring operations for small-object workloads (operations can dominate).</li>
    <li>Modeling "bucket size" but missing egress and replication boundaries.</li>
    <li>Double-counting CDN bandwidth and origin egress.</li>
    <li>Ignoring peak restores/backfills (the peak month often drives cost).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm whether you are estimating GB or GiB and keep units consistent end-to-end.</li>
    <li>Separate storage, requests, replication, and egress into distinct line items (no blended assumptions).</li>
    <li>When using a CDN, validate origin egress separately from edge bandwidth.</li>
    <li>After one cycle, reconcile usage types (storage vs operations vs transfer) against the model and keep a peak scenario.</li>
  </ul>
