  <p>
    DNS query charges are volume-based, so the key input is <strong>queries per month</strong>. The best estimates come
    from measured query counts, not guesswork.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: From Route 53 metrics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use query count metrics per hosted zone (or per record set if available) and roll up to a month.</li>
    <li>Choose a window that represents typical load (e.g., last 30 days).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: From resolver logs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count DNS requests from resolver logs, then roll up by day.</li>
    <li>Segment by domain/service to identify the top query drivers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sanity checks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Low TTLs increase query volume and reduce cache effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Retry loops and service discovery churn can explode query rates.</li>
    <li>Kubernetes cluster size can multiply lookups if workloads resolve frequently.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn volume into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-route-53-cost-calculator/">AWS Route 53 Cost Calculator</a> with your query volume and
    effective $ per 1M queries pricing.
