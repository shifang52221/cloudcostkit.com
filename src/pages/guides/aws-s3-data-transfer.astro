  <p>
    For many storage-heavy systems, S3 data transfer (egress) becomes the largest line item long before storage does.
    This guide helps you model transfer in a way that avoids double-counting and missed costs.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Map the transfer boundary (draw the path)</h2>
  <p>
    Transfer estimates fail when you do not define what is "inside" vs "outside" the billed boundary. Start by drawing a simple path for a real request:
    client -&gt; CDN (optional) -&gt; origin (S3) -&gt; compute -&gt; other regions -&gt; external systems.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet egress</strong>: S3 to the public internet (downloads to users, customers, partners)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CDN origin egress (cache fill)</strong>: S3 to CDN on cache misses, revalidation, and edge fills
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-region reads</strong>: app in Region A reading a bucket in Region B
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Replication/copy traffic</strong>: CRR/SRR, batch copies, migrations, backfills
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Private networking paths</strong>: VPC endpoints, inter-AZ traffic, and "inside the cloud" flows that still show up as transfer usage types
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Estimate GB/month (3 practical methods)</h2>
  <p>Choose the method that matches what you can measure today. You can refine later.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Throughput method</strong>: if you have Mbps charts (APM, CDN analytics, load balancer metrics), convert Mbps to GB/month with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Request method</strong>: if you know requests/day and average bytes served, compute GB/month. Tool:{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">API response transfer</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Billing/log method</strong>: prefer measured bytes from CUR/Cost Explorer, S3 access logs, or CDN metrics. This avoids unit mistakes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Price the right line item (egress vs cross-region vs CDN)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet egress</strong>: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">data egress cost</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-region</strong>: <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">cross-region transfer</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CDN bandwidth</strong>: <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN bandwidth</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    A common pattern is paying both: (1) CDN bandwidth (edge-to-user) and (2) origin egress (S3-to-CDN) on cache fill. They are not the same GB.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>User downloads</strong> = downloads/month * average object size (GB)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CDN cache fill</strong> = cache misses/month * average object size (GB) + revalidation traffic (if meaningful)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-region reads</strong> = reads/month * average read size (GB) for each region boundary
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Replication</strong> = changed data replicated (GB/month) + one-time backfill (if any)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls (transfer is easy to mis-price)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Separate <strong>CDN bandwidth</strong> (edge-to-user) from <strong>S3 origin egress</strong> (S3-to-CDN cache
      fill). Guide: <a href="/guides/origin-egress-vs-cdn-bandwidth/">origin egress vs CDN bandwidth</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Mixing <strong>replication</strong> traffic with user downloads. Replication is driven by writes/churn, not reads.</li>
    <li>Forgetting the "inside cloud" boundary (cross-region reads, private networking, NAT/egress paths).</li>
    <li>Using average object size without checking compression, partial responses, or range requests.</li>
    <li>Unit errors: GB vs GiB and Mbps vs MB/s (use the Units Converter if you're unsure).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In CUR/Cost Explorer, group by usage type and confirm your model maps to real transfer usage lines.</li>
    <li>Compare your estimated GB/month to CDN analytics bytes served and to S3 access logs (if enabled).</li>
    <li>Spot-check a top 1-3 endpoints/prefixes to confirm average response size assumptions.</li>
  </ul>
