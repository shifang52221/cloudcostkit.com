  <p>
    For many storage-heavy systems, S3 data transfer (egress) becomes the largest line item long before storage does.
    This guide helps you model transfer in a way that avoids double-counting and missed costs.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Identify what kind of transfer you have</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Internet egress (downloads to end users or external systems)</li>
    <li>Cross-region access patterns (multi-region apps reading from S3)</li>
    <li>Replication/copy traffic (CRR or replication features)</li>
    <li>CDN origin egress (cache fill) if you use a CDN in front of S3</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Estimate GB/month</h2>
  <p>
    Start from analytics if you have them. If you only have throughput charts, convert Mbps to GB/month using the Units
    Converter.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Throughput method: use <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a> to convert Mbps to GB/month.
    </li>
    <li>
      Request method: convert from response sizes with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">API response transfer</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Billing/metrics method: prefer measured bytes (billing exports, storage access logs, CDN metrics).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Price the right boundary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Internet egress: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">data egress cost</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Cross-region: <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">cross-region transfer</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      CDN bandwidth: <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN bandwidth</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist (avoid double counting)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Separate <strong>CDN bandwidth</strong> (edge-to-user) from <strong>S3 origin egress</strong> (S3-to-CDN cache
      fill). Guide: <a href="/guides/origin-egress-vs-cdn-bandwidth/">origin egress vs CDN bandwidth</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Separate user downloads from replication traffic (different drivers and sometimes different pricing).</li>
    <li>Validate units: GB vs GiB (use the Units Converter if you're unsure).</li>
  </ul>
