  <p>
    For many storage-heavy systems, S3 data transfer (egress) becomes the largest line item long before storage does.
    This guide helps you model transfer in a way that avoids double-counting and missed costs.
  </p>

  <h2>What to include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Internet egress (downloads to end users or external systems)</li>
    <li>Cross-region access patterns</li>
    <li>Replication/copy traffic (if billed as transfer in your setup)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate GB/month</h2>
  <p>
    Start from analytics if you have them. If you only have throughput charts, convert Mbps to GB/month using the Units
    Converter.
