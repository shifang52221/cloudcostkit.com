  <p>
    Container registries are “storage + transfer”. A clean estimate separates what you store from what you pull, and splits
    transfer by where it goes (same region, cross-region, internet).
  </p>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Build a GB-month estimate from your retention policy: average image size × number of tags retained × number of repos.
    If tags share layers, storage is less than “tags × size”, so validate with real registry stats when possible.

  </p>

  <h2>2) Pull volume</h2>
  <p>
    Pulls scale with CI/CD, autoscaling, and node churn. A good first model is:
    <strong>deployments per day × pulls per deployment × image size</strong>. Add a multiplier for cache misses.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Data transfer (egress)</h2>
  <p>
    Transfer is often the hidden part: cross-region cluster pulls, external runners, or edge nodes. Split outbound transfer
    by destination and validate where billing applies.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate retention policy and garbage collection (old tags/layers can keep storage high).</li>
    <li>Validate pull counts during peak CI windows and during cluster scale-out events.</li>
    <li>Validate where transfer is billed (same-region vs cross-region vs internet).</li>
  </ul>
