  <p>
    Container registries are "storage + transfer". A clean estimate separates what you store from what you pull, and
    splits transfer by where it goes (same region, cross-region, internet). ACR pricing tiers (Basic/Standard/Premium)
    change limits and features, but the cost model still depends on storage, pulls, and egress. Most surprises come from
    retention drift and pull storms (CI peaks, autoscaling, node churn).
  </p>

  <h2>ACR pricing tiers (Basic, Standard, Premium)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basic</strong>: entry tier for low traffic and small teams.</li>
    <li><strong>Standard</strong>: higher throughput and scale for production workloads.</li>
    <li><strong>Premium</strong>: advanced features (geo-replication, private networking) with the highest limits.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Tier selection affects limits and features, but your monthly spend still comes from stored GB-month, pull volume, and
    billed data transfer paths.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define your registry scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Environments</strong>: prod + staging + dev registries (or one shared registry with multiple repos).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Regions</strong>: cross-region clusters and geo-replication change transfer patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consumers</strong>: AKS nodes, VM scale sets, and external runners can each have different pull behavior.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Build a GB-month estimate from retention: average image size * tags retained * repos. Then adjust with reality: images
    share layers, so storage is often less than "tags * size" when tags reuse common layers.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Storage cost (GB-month)</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you store many versions, keep a separate line for "base images" and "app images" (they behave differently).
    </li>
    <li>
      Model a growth rate if you keep long-lived tags (release tags, hotfix branches, multiple architectures).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Pull volume (the hidden spike)</h2>
  <p>
    Pulls scale with CI/CD, autoscaling, and node churn. A good first model is:
    <strong>deployments/day * pulls per deployment * image size</strong>. Add a multiplier for cache misses and fresh nodes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>CI peaks</strong>: parallel builds and frequent pipeline retries can create pull storms.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cluster scale-outs</strong>: new nodes pull many images at once (worst during incidents).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Warm caches</strong>: node-local caching can reduce pulls dramatically; do not assume every pod pull hits ACR.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Data transfer (egress)</h2>
  <p>
    Transfer is often the second bill: cross-region pulls, external runners, and any delivery outside your region. Split
    outbound transfer by destination and validate which paths are billed.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data egress cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Cross-region and geo-replication effects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If clusters pull from a registry in another region, model that as cross-region transfer, not "free internal traffic".
    </li>
    <li>
      If you enable geo-replication, treat replication as its own line item (replicated data and any operational overhead).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage GB-month</strong> = avg stored GB over month (validate with registry stats if possible)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pull GB/month</strong> = pulls/month * avg image size (GB) (baseline + peak)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress GB/month</strong> = pull GB to destinations that are billed as outbound (cross-region/internet)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Retention drift: old tags and layers kept forever.</li>
    <li>Assuming tags * size equals storage (layer sharing changes the math).</li>
    <li>Ignoring CI and scale-out peaks (pull storms are the peak scenario).</li>
    <li>Cross-region pulls hidden inside "it's internal" assumptions.</li>
    <li>Missing that egress can dominate if you pull from outside the region.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate retention policy and garbage collection behavior (old layers keep storage high).</li>
    <li>Sample pull counts during peak CI windows and cluster scale-out events.</li>
    <li>Validate where transfer is billed (same-region vs cross-region vs internet).</li>
  </ul>
