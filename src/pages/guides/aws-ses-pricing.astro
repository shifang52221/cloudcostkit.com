  <p>
    SES cost modeling is usually straightforward: <strong>emails sent</strong> multiplied by your effective <strong>$ per
    1,000 emails</strong>. If you send large payloads or attachments, you may also want to model transfer-like costs.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Emails/month</strong>: transactional + marketing volume
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Average email size</strong>: templates, images, and attachments (optional)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add-ons</strong>: dedicated IPs or other features you enable
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-ses-cost-calculator/">AWS SES Cost Calculator</a> to estimate send charges and optional
    transfer from average email size.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Separate transactional vs marketing volume (different variability and spike patterns).</li>
    <li>Watch for incident spikes: alert storms and retry loops can multiply sends quickly.</li>
    <li>Validate average email size if you include transfer/attachment assumptions.</li>
  </ul>
