  <p class="muted">
    For planning, you want a reasonable estimate of "how many distinct metrics/series will I pay for?" You can get close
    with a simple approach: base metrics x dimensions.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Start from services and key metrics</h2>
  <p>
    List your services (or teams) and the key metrics you actually alert on or dashboard. Start small; avoid counting
    every default metric.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Multiply dimensions carefully</h2>
  <p>
    Each dimension label can multiply the number of unique series. For example:
    <br />
    <strong>service x environment x cluster x namespace x pod</strong> can explode quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Validate with real counts</h2>
  <p>
    When you have metrics, validate the actual number of custom metrics/active series in your billing/monitoring view and
    update your model.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Use a calculator for monthly cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-metrics-cost-calculator/">CloudWatch Metrics Cost Calculator</a> to translate your
    custom metrics + alarms + dashboards into a monthly estimate.
