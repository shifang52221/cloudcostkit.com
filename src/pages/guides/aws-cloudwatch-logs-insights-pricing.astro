  <p>
    Logs Insights pricing usually boils down to one number: <strong>GB scanned</strong>. A cost model should separate
    “routine” scanning (dashboards and daily debugging) from “incident” scanning (wide searches and repeated queries).
  </p>

  <h2>Logs Insights pricing inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GB scanned</strong>: per query scan volume.</li>
    <li><strong>Queries/day</strong>: dashboards and ad hoc usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Peak scans</strong>: incident searches can dominate.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>What to include in an estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Scanned GB/month</strong>: routine queries + dashboards
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Incident multiplier</strong>: scanning spikes during outages and security investigations
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Log group scope</strong>: which environments and services are included in your common queries
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Fast modeling workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Estimate log volume (GB/day) for the log groups you query.</li>
    <li>Estimate scanned GB/query from time range and log group scope.</li>
    <li>Estimate queries/day (dashboards + ad-hoc + scheduled).</li>
    <li>Multiply to monthly scanned GB and apply your $/GB scanned rate.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What matters (and what doesn't)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Matters</strong>: time range, log group scope, and query frequency (these drive scanned GB).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Doesn't matter much</strong>: how many rows you return. A query that returns 10 rows can still scan terabytes if it searches broadly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked example (routine vs incident)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Routine: 3 GB scanned/query × 150 queries/day × 30.4 ~= 13,680 GB scanned/month</li>
    <li>Incidents: 2 days/month at 10× scanning -> add ~ (3 × 150 × 9) × 2 ~= 8,100 GB scanned/month</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    The point is not perfect math. The point is that incident behavior can be a significant fraction of monthly spend.
  </p>

  <h2>Rules of thumb (quick checks)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Halving the time range usually halves scanned GB (first-order).</li>
    <li>Separating noisy log groups reduces scanned GB for routine error queries.</li>
    <li>Dashboards should default to 15m/1h windows; widen only on demand.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Querying multiple environments (prod + staging) by default.</li>
    <li>Dashboards that scan 7–30 days on a short refresh interval.</li>
    <li>Broad queries over noisy success logs for questions about errors.</li>
    <li>Not modeling incident behavior (where scan volume is often highest).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Optimization direction</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    The safest optimization is usually to reduce scan scope, not to reduce logging itself. Start by time-bounding queries
    and separating noisy log groups.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure scanned GB for a real week (including at least one busy day if possible).</li>
    <li>Validate dashboard time ranges and refresh intervals.</li>
    <li>Validate which log groups are included in the most common queries.</li>
  </ul>
