  <p class="muted">
    Logs Insights-style pricing is usually driven by how much log data your queries scan. The safest way to budget is to
    estimate scanned GB/day and multiply by your $/GB scan price.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Separate three log line items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ingestion</strong>: GB ingested per day.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention</strong>: stored GB-month over your retention window.</li>
    <li><strong>Query scan</strong>: GB scanned by queries (Insights).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-log-cost-calculator/">CloudWatch Logs Cost Calculator</a> for ingestion + retention,
    and <a href="/calculators/cloudwatch-logs-insights-cost-calculator/">Logs Insights Cost Calculator</a> for scan costs.
  </p>

  <h2>2) What to model for query scan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Typical queries per day (dashboards + ad hoc)</li>
    <li>Typical time range (last 15m vs last 24h matters)</li>
    <li>How selective your filters are (narrow early vs scan everything)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Dashboards refreshing too frequently.</li>
    <li>Queries run across “all log groups” without narrowing first.</li>
    <li>Incident loops that repeatedly re-run expensive queries.</li>
  </ul>
