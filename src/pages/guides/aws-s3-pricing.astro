  <p>
    S3-like object storage pricing looks simple until you add data movement. A solid model covers four common buckets:
    <strong>storage</strong>, <strong>requests</strong>, <strong>egress</strong>, and <strong>replication/copy</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use average stored GB (GB-month). If your dataset grows, average is more accurate than end-of-month GB.
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object storage cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Requests (GET/PUT/LIST)</h2>
  <p>
    Requests are often small for large-object workloads, but can be material for millions of small objects.
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/s3-request-cost-calculator/">S3 request cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Egress (data transfer out)</h2>
  <p>
    Egress is the most common surprise cost. If you read lots of data out of storage, $/GB transfer can dominate.
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data egress cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Replication and cross-region copy</h2>
  <p>
    Replication fees are driven by <em>changed data</em> (replicated GB/month), not total stored GB. Estimate replication
    volume from writes and churn, then apply a $/GB assumption. Tools:
    <a href="/guides/estimate-replication-gb-per-month-from-writes/">estimate replication volume</a> and
    <a href="/calculators/s3-replication-cost-calculator/">S3 replication cost calculator</a>.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate which boundary is billed: storage, requests, egress, replication, retrieval.</li>
    <li>Separate CDN bandwidth from origin egress (cache fill) when using a CDN.</li>
    <li>Validate units (GB vs GiB) and request units (per 1k/10k/1M).</li>
  </ul>
