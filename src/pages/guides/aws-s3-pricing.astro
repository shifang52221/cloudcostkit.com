  <p>
    S3-like object storage pricing looks simple until you add data movement. A solid model covers four common buckets:
    <strong>storage</strong>, <strong>requests</strong>, <strong>egress</strong>, and <strong>replication/copy</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define what you are estimating (and for which month)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Budget month</strong>: pick a month that reflects typical usage (or define baseline + peak).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Boundary</strong>: are you estimating "S3 only" or "S3 + delivery" (CDN, transfer, replication)?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Regions</strong>: cross-region patterns change the bill more than many teams expect.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Use average stored GB (GB-month). If your dataset grows, average is more accurate than end-of-month GB.
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">Object storage cost</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Split by tier if needed (hot / warm / archive). For tiering decisions, see <a href="/guides/aws-s3-storage-classes/">S3 storage classes</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If lifecycle moves data to Glacier/Deep Archive, treat retrieval as a separate driver, not a footnote.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Requests (GET/PUT/LIST)</h2>
  <p>
    Requests are often small for large-object workloads, but can be material for millions of small objects.
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/s3-request-cost-calculator/">S3 request cost calculator</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer measured counts from billing exports or access logs.</li>
    <li>
      If you only have RPS, convert with <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Egress (data transfer out)</h2>
  <p>
    Egress is the most common surprise cost. If you read lots of data out of storage, $/GB transfer can dominate.
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data egress cost</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    If you use a CDN, separate edge bandwidth from origin egress. Guide: <a href="/guides/origin-egress-vs-cdn-bandwidth/">origin egress vs CDN bandwidth</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Replication and cross-region copy</h2>
  <p>
    Replication fees are driven by <em>changed data</em> (replicated GB/month), not total stored GB. Estimate replication
    volume from writes and churn, then apply a $/GB assumption. Tools:
    <a href="/guides/estimate-replication-gb-per-month-from-writes/">estimate replication volume</a> and
    <a href="/calculators/s3-replication-cost-calculator/">S3 replication cost calculator</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Include destination storage (you usually store the data twice).</li>
    <li>Keep a one-time backfill scenario separate from steady-state replication.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong> = average GB-month (split by tier if needed)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong> = GET + PUT + LIST + other request classes (measured or derived from RPS)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer</strong> = internet egress + cross-region reads + CDN origin egress (modeled separately)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Replication</strong> = replicated GB/month + destination storage + any one-time backfill
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Modeling only "bucket size" and missing transfer and replication.</li>
    <li>Using one average for requests and missing short spikes (deploys, batch, incidents).</li>
    <li>Double-counting CDN bandwidth and origin egress as the same GB.</li>
    <li>Ignoring object-count effects (small objects increase request costs and operational overhead).</li>
    <li>Forgetting that replication is driven by writes/churn, not total stored data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In CUR/Cost Explorer, confirm distinct usage lines for storage, requests, and transfer exist as expected.</li>
    <li>Validate units: GB vs GiB and request units (per 1k/10k/1M). Do not mix request classes.</li>
    <li>Reconcile one representative week of logs/metrics against your baseline assumptions.</li>
  </ul>
