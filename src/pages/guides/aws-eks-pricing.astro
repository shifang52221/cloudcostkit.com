  <p>
    The easiest way to underestimate EKS cost is to model only nodes. Node compute is usually the biggest part, but a
    realistic budget includes several surrounding line items.
  </p>

  <h2>Baseline: node cost</h2>
  <p>
    Start by sizing nodes from workload requests, then apply a blended $/hour. Tools:
    <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-requests-limits-calculator/">Requests &amp; limits</a> and
    <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-node-cost-calculator/">node cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Common add-ons</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Control plane fee</strong>: fixed hourly fee in many managed Kubernetes offerings.</li>
    <li><strong>Load balancers / gateways</strong>: can be significant for high-traffic services.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: PVs, snapshots, and object storage buckets.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs and metrics</strong>: often the biggest surprise cost.</li>
    <li><strong>Data transfer</strong>: cross-zone/region traffic and internet egress.</li>
  </ul>
