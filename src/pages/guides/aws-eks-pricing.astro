  <p>
    The easiest way to underestimate EKS cost is to model only nodes. Nodes are usually the biggest line item, but a
    realistic budget includes a fixed per-cluster fee, storage and snapshots, load balancers, networking transfer, and
    observability volume. Use this page as a checklist and a template for a first-pass estimate.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Control plane (fixed fee per cluster)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Estimate monthly control plane cost as <strong>clusters × $/hour × 730</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      It matters most for many small clusters (dev/test/stage sprawl), not for one large production cluster.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>2) Nodes (compute + attached storage)</h2>
  <p>
    Most clusters are node-hour driven. Start from requests-based sizing and a utilization target, then convert to node
    count and node-hours.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Node-hours</strong>: node count × hours/month (and separate always-on vs scheduled groups if applicable).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Packing efficiency</strong>: topology constraints, DaemonSets, and pod caps reduce real utilization.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Attached storage</strong>: EBS root volumes and any node-local storage are separate line items.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>3) Load balancers and ingress</h2>
  <p>
    Load balancers are often a hidden baseline cost because they’re always-on. The drivers are “how many” and “how much
    traffic/capacity”.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Count the always-on LBs (one-per-service patterns can multiply quickly).</li>
    <li>Model capacity units for typical and peak traffic windows.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>4) Observability (logs and metrics)</h2>
  <p>
    For many teams, observability becomes the “surprise bill” after the cluster is stable. If you don’t model it, your
    estimate is fragile.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong>: ingestion GB/day × retention (plus any scan/search costs).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Metrics</strong>: time series count grows with cardinality (labels) and scrape frequency.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>5) Networking: NAT, cross-AZ, and internet egress</h2>
  <p>
    Kubernetes often increases east-west traffic (service-to-service calls). If traffic crosses AZs or routes through
    NAT, costs can show up fast.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT</strong>: processed GB for private workloads calling public endpoints or AWS services without endpoints.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-AZ</strong>: service chatter and load balancer routing can create steady transfer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet egress</strong>: APIs, downloads, and CDN origin traffic.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>6) Storage and snapshots (PVs and backups)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>PVs</strong>: GB-month for block storage and the growth rate over time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Snapshots</strong>: snapshot GB-month and retention policy.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Related: <a href="/guides/aws-ebs-snapshot-cost/">EBS snapshot cost</a>
  </p>

  <h2>First-pass estimate template (inputs to collect)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cluster count (by environment and region)</li>
    <li>Average node count + instance $/hour (or blended on-demand/spot mix)</li>
    <li>Always-on load balancer count and rough traffic/capacity assumptions</li>
    <li>Log ingestion GB/day and retention (days)</li>
    <li>NAT processed GB/month and cross-AZ transfer assumptions</li>
    <li>PV storage GB-month and snapshot retention</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you’re missing a number, write down an assumption and validate it after deployment instead of pretending it’s zero.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Budgeting from peak nodes (overestimates) or from perfect packing (underestimates) without headroom.</li>
    <li>Cluster sprawl in non-prod making fixed per-cluster fees and add-ons balloon.</li>
    <li>One load balancer per service creating a large always-on baseline.</li>
    <li>Ignoring log/metric growth (cardinality) until the bill arrives.</li>
    <li>Accidental NAT and cross-AZ traffic from “it just works” routing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate after the first month</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Group EKS costs by service and usage type: confirm your top 3 drivers match your model.</li>
    <li>Check node-hours vs the planned node count; investigate fragmentation if it’s higher than expected.</li>
    <li>Review load balancer count and utilization; consolidate where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Measure log ingestion GB/day and retention; tune verbosity and sampling intentionally.</li>
    <li>Check NAT processed GB and cross-AZ transfer; adjust routing and endpoints if needed.</li>
  </ul>
