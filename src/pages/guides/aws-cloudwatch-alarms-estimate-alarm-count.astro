    Alarm pricing is usually per-alarm-month, so you mainly need one number: how many alarms exist by type. The goal is
    not precision to the last alarm, but to avoid missing multiplicative patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Inventory by environment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Prod vs staging vs dev often multiplies alarm count.</li>
    <li>Count alarms per region/account if you have multi-account structure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Look for multiplicative patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Per-pod or per-node alarms in Kubernetes.</li>
    <li>Per-tenant or per-customer alarms in multi-tenant systems.</li>
    <li>One alarm per queue/topic/table with auto-provisioned resources.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Separate by alarm type</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard vs high-resolution vs composite (pricing differs).</li>
    <li>Flag any high-resolution alarms that can be downgraded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn counts into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-cloudwatch-alarms-cost-calculator/">AWS CloudWatch Alarms Cost Calculator</a> to translate
    counts into a monthly estimate using your $/alarm-month prices.
