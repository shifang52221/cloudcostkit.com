  <p>
    To estimate CloudWatch alarm cost, you need one input per alarm type: <strong>alarm-month count</strong>. The tricky
    part is that alarm counts are rarely stable: autoscaling, ephemeral environments, and copy-paste monitoring packs can
    change the number by 2–10× over time.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: count current alarms by type (baseline)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Standard alarms</strong>: default evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-resolution alarms</strong>: faster detection; priced separately.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Composite alarms</strong>: rollups of multiple alarms.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 2: include environments and time fraction</h2>
  <p>
    Alarm-month is proportional to time. If a PR environment exists 3 days and creates 60 alarms, the alarm-month
    contribution is roughly:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>60 alarms * (3 / 30.4) ~= 5.9 alarm-months</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    This is why short-lived environments with “full production alarm packs” can quietly become expensive.
  </p>

  <h2>Three practical inventory methods (pick one)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>CloudWatch inventory</strong>: list existing alarms and group by alarm type and environment tag or name
      prefix.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>IaC source-of-truth</strong>: count alarms defined in Terraform/CloudFormation and multiply by the number
      of stacks/environments.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Monitoring templates</strong>: if you generate alarms from templates, count template expansion rules (per
      service, per instance, per queue, etc.).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Spot the scaling multipliers (what makes it explode)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Per-instance alarms</strong>: alarm count scales with fleet size (N instances -> N alarms).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Per-dimension alarms</strong>: per tenant/customer/region dimensions multiply the base set.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Per-team duplication</strong>: teams copy the same alarms for shared components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ephemeral stacks</strong>: PR environments, sandboxes, and test deployments add time-weighted alarm-months.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Model growth scenarios (so you don't re-estimate every month)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fleet growth</strong>: if you use per-instance alarms, model alarm count as proportional to instance count.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Team growth</strong>: if each new service includes a full alarm pack, model alarms as “alarms per service”.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ephemeral usage</strong>: if PR environments are common, model “environments active per day” as a driver.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Even a simple scenario (baseline month vs busy month) is better than a single point estimate for planning.
  </p>

  <h2>Cross-check: does the number make operational sense?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How many alarms fired in the last 30 days vs total alarm count?</li>
    <li>How many alarms have never fired (or always OK) in the last 90 days?</li>
    <li>Can on-call engineers name what the top 20 alarms are for?</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If most alarms never fire and nobody can explain their purpose, you likely have a high “alarm-month waste” rate.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Count by type (standard/high-res/composite) and by environment (prod/staging/dev).</li>
    <li>Pro-rate ephemeral environments by days active per month.</li>
    <li>Identify scaling multipliers (fleet size, tenants, regions) and model growth scenarios.</li>
  </ul>
