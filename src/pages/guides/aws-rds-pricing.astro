    RDS pricing varies by engine and storage type, but a simple cost model usually gets you close enough for planning:
    compute + storage + backups + (optional) I/O.
  </p>

  <h2>RDS cost components (checklist)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Compute</strong>: instance-hours for primary + read replicas + any standby capacity (Multi-AZ).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>DB storage</strong>: GB-month (and sometimes provisioned IOPS/throughput depending on storage type).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backup storage</strong>: GB-month for automated backups + manual snapshots + copied snapshots.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I/O</strong>: only for pricing models that charge per request; otherwise treat as performance risk, not a
      billing line.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Extras</strong>: monitoring/log exports, data transfer between AZs/regions, and encryption-related
      operations (varies by setup).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Start with compute (instance hours)</h2>
  <p>
    For budgeting, model <strong>instances x hours/month x $/hour</strong>. If you have read replicas or Multi-AZ, model
    them as extra instances.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you scale by environment (prod vs staging), budget each environment separately. Non-prod often wins most from
      schedules and right-sizing.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you plan to commit (Reserved Instances / Savings Plans), use an <strong>effective $/hour</strong> and validate
      break-even utilization. Related:{" "}
      <a href="/guides/aws-reserved-vs-on-demand/">Reserved vs on-demand</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Add database storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Storage is typically billed per GB-month. Use your expected allocated storage (or average used storage if your plan
    bills that way).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Storage type matters. Some options add line items for <strong>provisioned IOPS</strong> and{" "}
      <strong>throughput</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Model <strong>growth</strong> over 3–12 months. Storage growth frequently beats compute as the long-term driver.
      Tool: <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">DB storage growth</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Model backups and snapshots</h2>
  <p>
    Backup storage can be a steady monthly cost, especially if you keep long retention or frequent snapshots. Use a
    separate estimate for <strong>backup GB-month</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next: <a href="/guides/aws-rds-backups-and-snapshots/">Backups & snapshots (how to estimate)</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Split backups into operational retention (days/weeks) vs long-term snapshots (months/years).</li>
    <li>Confirm whether you copy snapshots cross-region or cross-account (often overlooked in budgets).</li>
    <li>
      If you already have an RDS footprint, validate from Cost Explorer before trusting a forward estimate: backup storage
      is visible as a usage-based line item.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Include I/O only if your pricing model charges for it</h2>
  <p>
    Some storage models charge per I/O request. If you don't have a reliable I/O estimate, run two scenarios: \"low
    I/O\" and \"high I/O\".
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Even when I/O is “free” in pricing, I/O patterns still matter because they drive instance sizing and performance
    risk.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Use a calculator for fast scenario planning</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-rds-cost-calculator/">AWS RDS Cost Calculator</a> to model instance hours + storage +
    backups + I/O with your own pricing assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked example (build a defensible budget)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose instance class and count (primary + replicas/standbys).</li>
    <li>Choose storage GB and expected monthly growth.</li>
    <li>Estimate backup storage using churn × retention (add long-term snapshots separately).</li>
    <li>Add a peak scenario (batch jobs, incidents) to understand downside risk.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="muted">
    If you can’t justify the inputs in one sentence each (“where this number comes from”), the estimate will not survive
    budget review.
  </p>

  <h2>How to validate after you deploy (so the model stays true)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In Cost Explorer, filter <strong>Service</strong> to Amazon RDS and group by <strong>Usage type</strong> to see the
      top drivers (instance-hours, storage, backup storage, I/O if applicable).
    </li>
    <li>
      Cross-check storage and growth from RDS metrics and your DB telemetry. If growth differs, fix the model (not the
      spreadsheet).
    </li>
    <li>
      If backup storage is higher than expected, audit retention settings and manual snapshots. Related:{" "}
      <a href="/guides/aws-rds-snapshot-retention-policy-cost/">snapshot retention cost model</a>.
    </li>
