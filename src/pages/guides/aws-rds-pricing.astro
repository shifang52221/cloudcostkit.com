  <p class="muted">
    RDS pricing varies by engine and storage type, but a simple cost model usually gets you close enough for planning:
    compute + storage + backups + (optional) I/O.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Start with compute (instance hours)</h2>
  <p>
    For budgeting, model <strong>instances x hours/month x $/hour</strong>. If you have read replicas or Multi-AZ, model
    them as extra instances.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Add database storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Storage is typically billed per GB-month. Use your expected allocated storage (or average used storage if your plan
    bills that way).
  </p>

  <h2>3) Model backups and snapshots</h2>
  <p>
    Backup storage can be a steady monthly cost, especially if you keep long retention or frequent snapshots. Use a
    separate estimate for <strong>backup GB-month</strong>.

  </p>

  <h2>4) Include I/O only if your pricing model charges for it</h2>
  <p>
    Some storage models charge per I/O request. If you don't have a reliable I/O estimate, run two scenarios: \"low
    I/O\" and \"high I/O\".
  </p>

  <h2>5) Use a calculator for fast scenario planning</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-rds-cost-calculator/">AWS RDS Cost Calculator</a> to model instance hours + storage +
    backups + I/O with your own pricing assumptions.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
