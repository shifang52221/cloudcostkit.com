  <p>
    Most log pricing models start with <strong>ingestion volume</strong>: how many GB of logs you send per day. This page
    gives quick ways to estimate GB/day when you don't have a clean export yet.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: From your log provider usage (best)</h2>
  <p>
    If you already have a bill or a usage dashboard, take the average daily ingestion over a representative window (7 or
    30 days). This is the most accurate planning input.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 2: From events per second and average event size</h2>
  <p>
    If you know roughly how many log events you emit and the average size per event:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>GB/day ≈ events/sec x avg bytes/event x 86,400 / 1,000,000,000</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Tips:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a sample of real logs to estimate bytes/event (not just a guessed number).</li>
    <li>Split by source (app logs, load balancer logs, audit logs) and add them up.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 3: From throughput (Mbps)</h2>
  <p>
    If you have throughput charts (for example, log shipper network usage), you can convert Mbps to GB/day with the{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>. Use an average value over time, not the peak.
  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compression and parsing</strong>: providers may bill on different byte counts.</li>
    <li><strong>Sampling</strong>: if you sample at source, event rates can change drastically in incidents.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicates</strong>: shipping the same logs twice inflates ingestion.</li>
    <li><strong>Verbose debug logs</strong>: one noisy component can dominate total GB/day.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next: translate GB/day into dollars</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have GB/day, estimate cost with:
