  <p>
    Most log pricing models start with <strong>ingestion volume</strong>: how many GB of logs you send per day. If you do
    not have a clean export yet, you can still estimate GB/day with a few practical methods and validate quickly once you
    have real telemetry.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: From your vendor usage export (best)</h2>
  <p>
    If you already have a bill or usage dashboard, take the average daily ingestion over a representative window (7 or 30
    days). This is the most accurate planning input.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer a window that includes a normal day and a peak day.</li>
    <li>If your workload is seasonal, keep separate baseline and peak months.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: From events per second and average event size</h2>
  <p>
    If you can estimate event rate and average event size, you can estimate GB/day with this formula (decimal GB):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>GB/day ~= events/sec × avg bytes/event × 86,400 ÷ 1,000,000,000</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">Log ingestion cost calculator</a> (includes event-rate conversion).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sample real logs to estimate bytes/event (do not guess a single number for everything).</li>
    <li>Split by source: access/ingress, application logs, audit/security logs.</li>
    <li>Keep a peak multiplier for incidents (errors and retries increase logs dramatically).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 3: From throughput (Mbps)</h2>
  <p>
    If you have throughput charts for your log shipper or exporter, convert average throughput into GB/day. Make sure you
    distinguish Mbps (bits) from MB/s (bytes).
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Unit converter</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>What to include (and what to separate)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Include: access logs, application logs, audit logs, infrastructure logs (kube, systemd), security logs (WAF/firewall).
    </li>
    <li>
      Separate: one-time migrations, bulk debug dumps, and synthetic monitoring (model as special cases).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls (why estimates miss)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Duplicate shipping</strong>: two agents ship the same logs (doubles ingestion).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Verbose debug logs</strong>: one noisy service dominates total volume.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multiline events</strong>: stack traces can be much larger than normal log lines.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-volume sources</strong>: ingress/firewall/audit logs are often bigger than application logs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Incident spikes</strong>: retries and errors create a peak month that looks nothing like baseline.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next: translate GB/day into dollars (and retention)</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have GB/day, you typically need at least two more line items: retention storage and optional scan/search.
  </p>
  <div class="btn-row">
    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">Ingestion cost</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/log-retention-storage-cost-calculator/">Retention storage</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/log-storage-cost-calculator/">Tiered storage</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/log-search-scan-cost-calculator/">Scan/search</a>
    <a class="btn" href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">Total log cost</a>
  </div>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick your top 3 log sources and measure their actual bytes/event (sample 100–1000 events).</li>
    <li>Validate baseline and peak separately (incident week vs normal week).</li>
    <li>After changes, verify ingestion GB/day moves in the expected direction and the bill follows.</li>
  </ul>
