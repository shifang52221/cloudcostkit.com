    q: "Do retrieval tiers change pricing?",
    a: "Yes. Faster tiers are typically more expensive. Choose the slowest tier that meets your workflow latency needs.",

  <p class="muted">
    Glacier retrieval pricing is a two-part bill: GB retrieved and retrieval requests. Understanding both is essential
    if you have many small objects or frequent restores.
  </p>

  <h2>The two retrieval price components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GB retrieved</strong>: volume of data restored and read.</li>
    <li><strong>Retrieval requests</strong>: number of objects restored (request-like fees).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Small-object amplification (why requests matter)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Restoring 1 TB as 1,000,000 objects creates far more request fees than a few large objects.</li>
    <li>If you archive many small files, request fees can dominate retrieval cost.</li>
    <li>Packaging or batching into fewer objects can materially reduce request fees.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tier choice changes cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fast tiers</strong>: higher $/GB and request pricing, but shorter latency.</li>
    <li><strong>Standard tiers</strong>: balance between cost and latency.</li>
    <li><strong>Bulk tiers</strong>: lowest cost, but slowest restores.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to estimate retrieval pricing (quick method)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Estimate retrieval GB/month (restores per month x avg restore size).</li>
    <li>Estimate retrieval requests/month (objects restored).</li>
    <li>Apply your tier pricing to both GB and requests.</li>
    <li>Run a peak scenario for backfills or audits.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Modeling only GB retrieved and ignoring request fees.</li>
    <li>Using stored GB as a proxy for retrieval GB.</li>
    <li>Forgetting that retrieval tiers change both latency and price.</li>
  </ul>
