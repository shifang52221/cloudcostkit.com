  <p>
    KMS-style pricing is usually a combination of <strong>key-month</strong> charges and <strong>request</strong> charges.
    The hardest part is attributing request volume across services that use KMS under the hood.
  </p>

  <h2>What to model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Customer managed keys</strong>: how many keys you maintain (often per environment/account)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong>: Encrypt/Decrypt/GenerateDataKey/etc. volume across all callers
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Request mix</strong>: use an effective blended $ per 10k requests for your workloads
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A fast estimate</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-kms-cost-calculator/">AWS KMS Cost Calculator</a> for a quick key + request estimate, then
    refine with measured request volume and caller breakdown.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify which services generate KMS calls (storage, secrets, databases, app crypto).</li>
    <li>Estimate requests/month from workload volume, then validate with a real week of KMS metrics/billing.</li>
    <li>Watch for spike drivers: retries/timeouts, cold starts, and high-frequency decrypt patterns.</li>
  </ul>
