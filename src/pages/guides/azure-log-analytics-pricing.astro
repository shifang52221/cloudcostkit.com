  <p>
    Log Analytics costs scale with volume. The safest estimate is a simple pipeline:
    <strong>events × size → GB ingested → retention storage → query scans</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Ingestion (GB)</h2>
  <p>
    Start with an event rate and average payload size. Multiply to get bytes/day, then convert to GB/day and GB/month.
    Add separate line items for big sources (ingress logs, audit logs, firewall logs) instead of averaging everything.

  </p>

  <h2>2) Retention (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Retention is “ingested GB per day × retention days” converted into GB-month. If you store a month of logs and ingest
    50 GB/day, you are roughly holding 1500 GB of data on average.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Query and scan costs</h2>
  <p>
    Query cost depends on how much data you scan per query and how often. Dashboards and alert rules can scan far more data
    than you expect, especially with broad time windows.

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the biggest sources (ingress/firewall/audit) and estimate them separately.</li>
    <li>Validate retention windows for each log type (short vs long retention).</li>
    <li>Validate dashboards/alerts for wide time windows that scan lots of data repeatedly.</li>
  </ul>
