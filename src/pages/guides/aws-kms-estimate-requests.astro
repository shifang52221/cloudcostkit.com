      q: "Why is KMS request estimation tricky?",
      a: "Because many services generate KMS requests indirectly. Your app may not call KMS directly, but encrypted storage, databases, or secrets access can still generate significant KMS traffic.",

  <p>
    The biggest driver of KMS cost is usually <strong>request volume</strong>. Start with a measured total, then find the
    biggest call sites.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: Measure and scale</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure total KMS requests over 7/30 days and scale to monthly.</li>
    <li>Separate by account/region if you have multiple deployments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: Break down by caller</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify top callers (applications, services, or roles) and their request rates.</li>
    <li>Look for hot paths: per-request crypto, secrets fetched on every request, or frequent re-encryption operations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 3: Sanity checks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Retry loops and timeouts can multiply KMS calls.</li>
    <li>High QPS services calling Decrypt frequently can dominate total requests.</li>
    <li>Per-object or per-record encryption in tight loops creates large request volume.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn requests into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-kms-cost-calculator/">AWS KMS Cost Calculator</a> with your measured requests/month and
    effective $ per 10k requests.
