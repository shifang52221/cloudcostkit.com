    Retrieval cost is often the surprise with archival storage. Model both GB retrieved and request count (objects
    retrieved). The same GB retrieved can have very different cost depending on whether it is a few large objects or
    millions of small objects.
  </p>

  <h2>Define "retrieval" for your workflow</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Restore</strong>: rehydrating an object so it becomes readable again.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Read after restore</strong>: your jobs scanning the restored data (often the real driver of how often you restore).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Object count</strong>: how many objects you restore, which maps to request-like fees and operational work.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 1: From restore events (best if you have history)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Restores/month x average restore GB = retrieval GB/month.</li>
    <li>Objects restored/month approximates retrieval requests/month.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If restores vary by day, do not use one average. Keep a baseline and a peak month (backfills and audits are typically the peak).
  </p>

  <h2>Method 2: From analytics workflows</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you rehydrate archives for analytics, model job frequency x data restored.</li>
    <li>Large-scale backfills can dominate a single month's cost.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 3: From object counts (when the request bill matters)</h2>
  <p>
    If your archive has many small objects, treat "objects restored/month" as a primary input, not an afterthought.
    Even modest GB restored can become expensive if it is split into millions of objects.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>List the top prefixes you restore from and estimate objects restored per job.</li>
    <li>Multiply by job frequency to get objects/month.</li>
    <li>Convert to cost using the archive calculator (it models GB and requests separately).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sanity checks (to avoid underestimating)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Many small objects can create very high request counts.</li>
    <li>Batching and packaging data into larger objects can reduce request charges.</li>
    <li>Repeated rehydration suggests you may need a warmer tier or cached analysis copy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Retrieval GB/month</strong> = restores/month * GB per restore (baseline + peak scenario)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retrieval requests/month</strong> = objects restored/month (baseline + peak scenario)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>One-time event</strong> = backfill restores (GB) + backfill objects (requests)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn retrieval into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-s3-glacier-cost-calculator/">AWS S3 Glacier / Deep Archive Cost Calculator</a> with your
    retrieval GB/month and retrieval requests/month assumptions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a baseline scenario from the most typical month.</li>
    <li>Create a peak scenario for audits/backfills and compare.</li>
    <li>Use Copy inputs (JSON) to share assumptions with teammates during review.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate the estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>After the first month, reconcile your model with actual restore events and billing usage types.</li>
    <li>Check whether your restores were concentrated in a few days (peaky usage) and keep the peak scenario.</li>
    <li>Verify object-count assumptions by sampling one representative job and counting restored objects.</li>
  </ul>
