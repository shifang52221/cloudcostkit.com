  <p>
    Retrieval cost is often the surprise with archival storage. Model both <strong>GB retrieved</strong> and <strong>request
    count</strong> (objects retrieved).
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: From restore events</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Restores/month x average restore GB = retrieval GB/month.</li>
    <li>Objects restored/month approximates retrieval requests/month.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: From analytics workflows</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you rehydrate archives for analytics, model job frequency x data restored.</li>
    <li>Large-scale backfills can dominate a single month’s cost.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sanity checks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Many small objects can create very high request counts.</li>
    <li>Batching and packaging data into larger objects can reduce request charges.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turn retrieval into cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-s3-glacier-cost-calculator/">AWS S3 Glacier / Deep Archive Cost Calculator</a> with your
    retrieval GB/month and retrieval requests/month assumptions.
