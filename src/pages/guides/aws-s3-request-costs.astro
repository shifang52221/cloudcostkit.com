  <p>
    Many teams ignore S3 request costs because storage and egress usually dominate. But requests become meaningful when
    you have millions of small objects, frequent LIST/HEAD calls, or chatty pipelines.
  </p>

  <h2>How to estimate request fees</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect request counts from logs/metrics/billing exports.</li>
    <li>Convert RPS to monthly requests if needed.</li>
    <li>Apply per-request-class pricing assumptions and sum.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/s3-request-cost-calculator/">S3 request cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm request unit pricing (per 1,000 / 10,000 / 1,000,000) for each request class.</li>
    <li>Separate request fees from transfer: high GET volume often also implies high egress.</li>
    <li>Look for a small number of noisy prefixes/endpoints driving most LIST/HEAD.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Patterns that drive request spikes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Frequent LIST operations over large prefixes</li>
    <li>Small-object workloads (higher requests per GB stored)</li>
    <li>ETL pipelines that repeatedly scan metadata</li>
  </ul>
