    RDS spend is often predictable. That's good news: a few simple levers usually deliver meaningful savings without risky
    architecture changes.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Right-size instances (and use schedules where possible)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Downsize over-provisioned instances after measuring CPU/IO/memory headroom.</li>
    <li>Use non-prod schedules (stop/scale down) if supported by your ops model.</li>
    <li>For stable workloads, compare on-demand vs commitments and use an effective $/hour in your budget model.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Control storage growth</h2>
  <p>
    Storage growth is easy to ignore until you hit a budget wall. Use{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">Database Storage Growth Calculator</a> to forecast the
    next 3-12 months.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Treat backups as a first-class cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set retention intentionally (don't default to "forever").</li>
    <li>Reduce churn where possible (batch writes, compaction, TTL strategies).</li>
    <li>Review snapshot frequency - more is not always better.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>4) Avoid expensive I/O patterns</h2>
  <p>
    If your storage pricing charges for I/O, optimize query patterns and indexes, and avoid full table scans. Model I/O
    as "low / high" scenarios in the calculator to see sensitivity.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Sanity-check with a simple calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-rds-cost-calculator/">AWS RDS Cost Calculator</a> to break your budget into compute,
    storage, backups, and I/O so you can see which lever matters most.
