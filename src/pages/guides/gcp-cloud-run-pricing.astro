  <p>
    Cloud Run-style platforms are predictable when you model the measurable drivers: requests, CPU/memory time, and outbound
    transfer. The main risk is to ignore response size and logging.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Requests</h2>
  <p>Convert traffic (RPS) to monthly requests and model peak vs average.</p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS → monthly requests</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Duration and concurrency</h2>
  <p>
    Use p50 and p95 request duration to model steady-state and spikes. Concurrency affects how many instances you run and
    can change CPU time per request if the service is resource constrained.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Response transfer and egress</h2>
  <p>
    If each request returns significant data, egress becomes a major driver. Estimate average response size and multiply by
    monthly requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">Response transfer</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Logs</h2>
  <p>
    Ingestion and retention can outweigh compute if you log too much per request. Estimate log bytes per request × request
    volume.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">Log cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate p50/p95 latency and retry storms (incidents multiply request volume and CPU time).</li>
    <li>Validate response size distribution (large payload endpoints should be modeled separately).</li>
    <li>Validate log volume per request and retention settings.</li>
  </ul>
