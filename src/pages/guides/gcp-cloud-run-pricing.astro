  <p>
    Cloud Run-style platforms are predictable when you model measurable drivers: requests, CPU/memory time (duration), and
    outbound transfer. The main mistakes are ignoring response size and logging, and ignoring peak periods where retries
    multiply costs.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Pick the right unit of analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong>: the driver for HTTP services.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Duration</strong>: the multiplier that turns requests into compute.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Concurrency</strong>: affects instance count and can change per-request CPU time under contention.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress</strong>: response bytes and external calls create transfer costs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong>: per-request bytes logged × request volume (often overlooked).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Requests (monthly volume)</h2>
  <p>
    Convert request rate to monthly requests and keep baseline + peak separate. Peaks include bot spikes, marketing events,
    and incident retry storms.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Duration and concurrency (compute time)</h2>
  <p>
    Use percentiles (p50 and p95) instead of one average so you can model normal vs slow-path behavior. Slow paths often
    come from upstream latency (DB/APIs), cold starts, and throttling.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you increase concurrency, validate latency and CPU contention; concurrency is not free for CPU-bound handlers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Track retries/timeouts: they multiply both request count and total compute time.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Response transfer and egress</h2>
  <p>
    If each request returns significant data, egress becomes a major driver. Estimate average response size and multiply by
    monthly requests, then split transfer by destination if needed.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/api-response-size-transfer-calculator/">Response transfer</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Model heavy-tail endpoints separately (downloads, exports) so they do not disappear into a blended average.
    </li>
    <li>
      Include external dependency calls that return large payloads (they create egress too).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Logs (often the second spike)</h2>
  <p>
    Logging can outweigh compute if you log too much per request. Estimate log bytes per request and multiply by request
    volume, then model retention and scan/search if you query heavily.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tools: <a href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">Log ingestion</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/log-storage-cost-calculator/">Tiered log storage</a>,{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/log-search-scan-cost-calculator/">Log scan</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests/month</strong> = baseline + peak (include retries)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Duration</strong> = p50 + p95 scenario (seconds)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress GB/month</strong> = requests/month × avg response size (GB) (split heavy endpoints)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Log GB/month</strong> = requests/month × avg log bytes/request (baseline + peak)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using only average duration and ignoring p95 (slow path drives cost and capacity).</li>
    <li>Ignoring retries/timeouts which multiply requests, duration, and downstream calls.</li>
    <li>Not modeling response size (egress dominates for large payloads).</li>
    <li>Verbose logs per request (ingestion dominates at scale).</li>
    <li>Not separating baseline vs peak months (incidents change the cost shape).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate p50/p95 latency and cold start behavior.</li>
    <li>Validate retries/timeouts and incident traffic windows.</li>
    <li>Validate top endpoints by bytes (not just by request count).</li>
    <li>Validate log bytes per request and retention settings.</li>
  </ul>
