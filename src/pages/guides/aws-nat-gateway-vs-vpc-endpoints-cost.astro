  <p>
    NAT Gateway is often the first surprise "networking bill" teams see. A common fix is to keep traffic private with
    VPC endpoints (Interface endpoints / PrivateLink, or Gateway endpoints where supported). This guide shows how to
    compare the costs in a practical way.
  </p>

  <h2>What you're comparing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT Gateway</strong>: hourly gateway cost + traffic-based GB processed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>VPC endpoints</strong>: endpoint hourly cost (and sometimes per-GB), plus whatever data transfer applies for
      your path.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When endpoints usually win</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>High-volume access to AWS services from private subnets (common CI/CD and node bootstrapping traffic).</li>
    <li>Frequent container image pulls (ECR) and package updates.</li>
    <li>Large fleets that multiply the same outbound downloads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 1: estimate what drives NAT GB processed</h2>
  <p>
    You need a rough monthly GB processed. Use metrics/flow logs when possible:
    <a href="/guides/aws-nat-gateway-estimate-gb-processed/"> estimate NAT GB processed</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: model NAT cost</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-nat-gateway-cost-calculator/">NAT Gateway cost calculator</a> for the baseline.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: model the endpoint alternative</h2>
  <p>
    For endpoints, treat it as a separate monthly line item: endpoint-hours plus any per-GB charges that apply to your
    plan. The key is to decide how much NAT GB processed the endpoint removes.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Practical approach: start with a percentage reduction scenario (for example, 30%, 60%, 90%) and see the break-even.
  </p>

  <h2>Don't forget transfer boundaries</h2>
  <p>
    Some "savings" plans accidentally increase cross-AZ or cross-region traffic. If your architecture moves traffic across
    boundaries, model it explicitly:
