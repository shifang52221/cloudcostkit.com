  <p>
    NAT Gateway is often the first surprise “networking bill” teams see. A common fix is to keep AWS-service traffic
    private with VPC endpoints (Interface endpoints / PrivateLink, or Gateway endpoints where available). This guide
    shows how to compare costs without hand-waving: estimate NAT processed GB, estimate endpoint-hours, and model how
    much NAT traffic endpoints actually remove.
  </p>

  <h2>What you’re comparing (two different cost shapes)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT Gateway</strong>: gateway-hours + GB processed (traffic-driven; spikes with downloads and retries).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>VPC endpoints</strong>: endpoint-hours (often per AZ) + sometimes per-GB processing (more fixed; scales with sprawl).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 1: estimate NAT processed GB (baseline + peak)</h2>
  <p>
    You need a rough monthly processed GB. Use metrics/flow logs when possible:
    <a href="/guides/aws-nat-gateway-estimate-gb-processed/"> estimate NAT GB processed</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Keep two scenarios: a normal week (baseline) and an incident/busy week (peaks often dominate monthly variance).
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: estimate how much of that GB endpoints can remove</h2>
  <p>
    Endpoints don’t remove all NAT traffic — they remove the portion that is headed to services you can keep on the
    private path. A practical way to estimate is to group NAT egress by destination.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AWS-service destinations</strong>: good candidates for endpoints/private access.</li>
    <li><strong>Public internet/SaaS</strong>: endpoints won’t help; you still need NAT or other egress.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you can’t attribute yet, start with scenarios (30% / 60% / 90% NAT reduction) and refine later.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: compare monthly costs with a scenario table</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT cost</strong> = gateway-hours × $/hour + GB processed × $/GB
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Endpoint cost</strong> = endpoint-hours × $/hour (+ optional per-GB) + remaining NAT cost for residual internet egress
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    The breakeven is usually “does the endpoint remove enough processed GB to beat its hourly baseline?”

  </div>

  <h2>When endpoints usually win</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Large fleets pulling the same artifacts (images, packages) from AWS services repeatedly.</li>
    <li>High-volume private workloads calling AWS APIs frequently (steady GB processed through NAT).</li>
    <li>Teams that can standardize endpoints and avoid endpoint sprawl (ownership and lifecycle).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When endpoints may not win</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Most NAT traffic is to the public internet or third-party SaaS (endpoints don’t remove it).</li>
    <li>Non-prod sprawl creates many endpoints across many AZs that stay always-on.</li>
    <li>Routing changes introduce cross-AZ transfer that offsets NAT savings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Don’t forget transfer boundaries (where “savings” can move)</h2>
  <p>
    Some migrations reduce NAT GB processed but increase cross-AZ transfer or internet egress in a different line item.
    Model transfer explicitly if your traffic crosses boundaries:
    <a href="/guides/aws-vpc-data-transfer/"> VPC data transfer guide</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist (after rollout)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm NAT processed GB dropped by the expected percentage.</li>
    <li>Confirm endpoint-hours match the intended footprint (no unexpected AZ/sprawl).</li>
    <li>Check for shifted spend: cross-AZ transfer and internet egress.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows; retries can recreate NAT spikes even after endpoints.</li>
  </ul>
