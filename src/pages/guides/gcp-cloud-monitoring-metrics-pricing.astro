  <p>
    Metrics systems are “time series × frequency × retention”. Costs spike when you accidentally create too many unique time
    series (high cardinality) or when dashboards/alerts query wide time windows frequently.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Cardinality (time series count)</h2>
  <p>
    Cardinality is the primary risk. Labels like <strong>pod</strong>, <strong>path</strong>, or <strong>customerId</strong>
    can create unbounded series counts. Model the number of unique label combinations explicitly.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Sample rate</h2>
  <p>
    Sample rate multiplies ingestion. A move from 60s to 10s increases samples ~6×. Model both normal and high-frequency
    scenarios.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Long retention multiplies stored volume. Consider downsampling or reducing retention for high-resolution metrics.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Dashboards and alerts</h2>
  <p>
    Dashboards refreshing every minute and alerts scanning long windows can create repeated query load. Treat refresh rates
    and time windows as explicit drivers.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate cardinality drivers and cap unbounded labels/dimensions.</li>
    <li>Validate sample rates (emit/scrape intervals) and ensure they match your needs.</li>
    <li>Validate dashboard refresh and alert windows (avoid repeated wide scans).</li>
  </ul>
