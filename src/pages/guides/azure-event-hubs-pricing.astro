  <p>
    Event streaming cost planning works best when you model <strong>bytes</strong> and <strong>replays</strong>. The same
    stream can be read multiple times by consumers, and that replay multiplier is where estimates often break down.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define the stream scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Producers</strong>: which services emit events and at what peak rate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consumers</strong>: number of consumer groups and whether they reprocess data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retention</strong>: how long data is kept and how often replays happen.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Ingestion volume (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate <strong>events/second * bytes/event</strong> to get bytes/second, then convert to GB/day and GB/month. Model
    top sources separately (audit logs, telemetry, clickstream) instead of using one blended average.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/log-ingestion-cost-calculator/">Ingestion calculator</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Keep a <strong>peak scenario</strong>: ingestion spikes during incidents, deploys, and backfills.
    </li>
    <li>
      Track event size distribution: a small fraction of "large events" can dominate GB/month.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Retention is the "how long do we keep data" multiplier. Long retention increases stored data and makes replays/backfills
    more likely.

    Tool: <a href="/calculators/log-retention-storage-cost-calculator/">Retention storage</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Consumer replays and downstream costs</h2>
  <p>
    The hidden cost is re-reading and processing the same data. If you have multiple consumer groups, frequent replays, or
    backfills, model a replay multiplier and validate consumer lag patterns.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Replay multiplier</strong>: how many times the same day of data is reprocessed (debugging, re-indexing, ML training).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Downstream</strong>: compute, logs, and data transfer in the consumer pipelines often dominate the Event Hubs line item.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ingest GB/month</strong> = events/sec * bytes/event * seconds/month / 1e9 (approx)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retention</strong> = ingest GB/day * retention days (order-of-magnitude)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Replay GB/month</strong> = ingest GB/month * replay multiplier (if consumers reprocess)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using average events/sec and missing burst traffic (capacity and cost depend on peaks).</li>
    <li>Ignoring consumer groups and replays/backfills (multipliers matter).</li>
    <li>Using one blended bytes/event when a few event types dominate size.</li>
    <li>Missing downstream cost: logs and compute in consumers can exceed the streaming bill.</li>
    <li>Keeping long retention by default "just in case".</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate peak ingestion vs average; keep the peak scenario in the model.</li>
    <li>Validate consumer lag and replay/backfill frequency.</li>
    <li>Validate retention settings and whether stored data is actually used.</li>
  </ul>
