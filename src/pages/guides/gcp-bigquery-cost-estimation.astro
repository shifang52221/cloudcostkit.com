  <p>
    Data warehouses are “pay for scans”. You can estimate BigQuery-like systems with two independent lines:
    <strong>storage</strong> (GB-month) and <strong>bytes scanned</strong> (per query × query count). If you stream data in,
    treat ingestion as another driver.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Start with average stored GB and retention. If you have daily partitions, storage often grows steadily; model growth rate
    and compute average size for the month.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>2) Query scans (bytes processed)</h2>
  <p>
    Estimate: queries per day × bytes scanned per query. Dashboards and scheduled jobs can scan large windows repeatedly,
    so model them explicitly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tip: if you don’t know bytes scanned, approximate it with “rows read × average row size” and validate later with query
    stats.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Streaming ingestion and exports</h2>
  <p>
    If you stream in events or export results frequently, model those paths separately. Ingestion is a volume problem; exports
    can become a transfer/egress problem.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate partitioning/clustering and ensure common queries prune partitions.</li>
    <li>Validate dashboard refresh rates and scheduled jobs (hidden repeated scans).</li>
    <li>Validate scan windows during incidents (retries can multiply query volume).</li>
  </ul>
