  },
  {
    q: "Why do network bills spike unexpectedly?",
    a: "Because network charges scale with traffic. Common causes are NAT GB processed from image pulls/updates, cross-AZ traffic from load balancers or multi-AZ clients, and log/monitoring traffic you didn't account for.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do VPC endpoints always reduce NAT costs?",
    a: "Only for compatible traffic (AWS services that support endpoints). Endpoints add their own hourly and (sometimes) per-GB charges, so you need a break-even model based on your traffic mix.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I do if I don't have perfect data yet?",
    a: "Use scenarios: estimate NAT GB processed and model 30% / 60% / 90% of that traffic moving to endpoints. Also model 2-AZ vs 3-AZ deployments for endpoints, because AZ count is a major multiplier.",

  <p>
    AWS networking cost modeling is simpler than it looks if you treat it as a set of consistent line items. This hub
    gives you a practical workflow (with formulas) and links to the calculators and deep guides.
  </p>

  <h2>The 3 buckets (the mental model)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT Gateway</strong>: hourly gateway fees + <strong>GB processed</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>VPC endpoints / PrivateLink</strong>: <strong>endpoint-hours</strong> (per AZ) + (sometimes) <strong>GB
      processed</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer boundaries</strong>: cross-AZ, cross-region, and internet egress (depends on architecture).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Core formulas (planning-safe)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      NAT hourly = NAT gateways x hours/month x $/gateway-hour
    </li>
    <li>
      NAT traffic = NAT GB processed/month x $/GB processed
    </li>
    <li>
      Interface endpoint-hours = endpoints x AZs x hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      Interface endpoint hourly = endpoint-hours x $/endpoint-hour
    </li>
    <li>
      Interface endpoint traffic = endpoint GB processed/month x $/GB processed
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Break-even workflow (NAT vs endpoints)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Estimate NAT GB processed today (baseline).
    </li>
    <li>
      Identify the share of NAT traffic that is actually to AWS services that can move to endpoints (S3, ECR, STS, etc).
    </li>
    <li>
      Model 30% / 60% / 90% traffic moved to endpoints, and compare total monthly cost.
    </li>
    <li>
      Validate you didn't accidentally increase cross-AZ/cross-region transfer (common hidden pitfall).
    </li>
  </ol>

        <tr>
          <th>Symptom</th>
          <th>Likely driver</th>
          <th>High-leverage fix</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>NAT bill dominated by GB processed</td>
          <td>Image pulls, updates, large outbound downloads</td>
          <td>Move AWS-service traffic to endpoints; cache/package mirrors</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Endpoint bill higher than expected</td>
          <td>3-AZ deployment + many endpoints</td>
          <td>Consolidate endpoints; validate which services need endpoints</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Cross-AZ transfer surprises</td>
          <td>Multi-AZ clients hitting single-AZ backends or LB patterns</td>
          <td>Keep traffic AZ-local where possible; validate routing/targets</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <h2>Troubleshooting checklist (what to verify)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Top talkers behind NAT (which destinations drive GB processed)</li>
    <li>AZ locality (client and backend in same AZ?)</li>
    <li>Retries/timeouts during incidents (traffic multiplier)</li>
    <li>Log/monitoring traffic you forgot (steady background costs)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
