  <p>
    AWS WAF vs Cloudflare WAF comparisons often go wrong because teams compare list prices without normalizing traffic
    shape. Use this checklist to compare apples-to-apples: baseline policies, evaluated requests, and the cost of
    security logging and analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Normalize traffic volume (including spikes)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Average requests/month (steady state)</li>
    <li>Peak hours and attack/bot scenarios</li>
    <li>Include blocked traffic if it is still evaluated</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Tooling: <a href="/guides/aws-waf-estimate-requests/">estimate WAF requests</a> and model a surge scenario.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Compare baseline policy/rule costs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How many apps/environments require distinct policies?</li>
    <li>How many rule groups (managed + custom) do you need?</li>
    <li>Do you pay extra for bot management, rate limiting, or advanced features?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Don't ignore the second bill: logs and analytics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Log delivery and ingestion cost (GB/day)</li>
    <li>Retention (GB-month)</li>
    <li>Query/scan costs for dashboards and incident response</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Operational and architecture constraints</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Where traffic is filtered (edge vs origin) and how that affects origin egress.</li>
    <li>How quickly you can deploy rule changes safely.</li>
    <li>How you export events into your existing security tooling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
