  <p>
    For Secrets Manager, the biggest cost surprises come from <strong>API request volume</strong> (often GetSecretValue).
    Start with measurement if you can, then refine the caller model.
  </p>

  <h2>Method 1: Measure and scale</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure total API calls over a representative 7/30 day window and scale to monthly.</li>
    <li>Break down by environment (prod/staging) and account if applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method 2: Model from runtime behavior</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instances/month = average running instances + restarts + autoscaling churn.</li>
    <li>Calls/instance = secrets fetched per process start (or per request if you do that).</li>
    <li>
      <strong>API calls/month ≈ instances/month x calls/instance</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common multipliers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fetching secrets on every request or every job iteration.</li>
    <li>Short-lived containers with frequent cold starts.</li>
    <li>Retry loops on timeouts and transient errors.</li>
  </ul>
