  <p class="muted">
    Storage cost estimates often fail because teams only price "stored GB". This guide gives a simple framework to model
    storage like a real bill: capacity (GB-month) plus activity (requests) plus copies (replication/backup) plus
    transfer.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Start with stored GB-month (capacity)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure average stored GB (or estimate from current size and growth).</li>
    <li>Price it with your $/GB-month rate (watch for storage class/tier changes).</li>
    <li>
      Tool: <a href="/calculators/object-storage-cost-calculator/">object storage cost calculator</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Add request fees (activity)</h2>
  <p>
    Storage is often paired with request pricing (PUT/GET/LIST). If you store many small objects, request fees can be a
    meaningful percentage of total cost.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimate PUT/GET counts per day, then convert to monthly.</li>
    <li>Check request units (per 1,000 / 10,000 / 1,000,000).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Add replication and backups (copies)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Replica storage</strong>: you store a second copy (often close to 1x extra GB-month).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Replication traffic</strong>: bytes copied may be billed as transfer depending on product.
    </li>

      Guide: <a href="/guides/s3-replication-cost/">S3 replication cost explained</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Add egress/transfer (the common surprise)</h2>
  <p>
    When data leaves the storage boundary (to users, to another region, or to a CDN/origin), you may pay egress. Many
    storage architectures are "bandwidth-shaped": the monthly bill grows with reads/deliveries.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Tools: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">egress cost</a>,{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/cross-region-transfer-cost-calculator/">cross-region transfer</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Guide: <a href="/guides/egress-costs/">egress costs explained</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ignoring growth: GB-month changes over time, even if pricing does not.</li>
    <li>Ignoring small-object amplification: request fees and metadata overhead.</li>
    <li>Counting CDN bandwidth but forgetting origin egress (cache fill).</li>
    <li>Double counting replication: both replica storage and copy traffic can be billed.</li>
  </ul>
