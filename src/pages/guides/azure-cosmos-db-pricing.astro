  <p>
    Cosmos DB pricing becomes manageable when you separate the drivers: <strong>capacity</strong>, <strong>storage</strong>,
    and <strong>data movement</strong>. Most surprises happen when RU demand is bursty or when retries amplify read/write
    volume.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Capacity (RU/s)</h2>
  <p>
    RU/s is capacity planning. Build an estimate from your top operations (reads, writes, queries) and use a peak-demand
    window. If you’re migrating, start with a baseline and a high-usage scenario rather than a single average.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tip: treat “retries” as a multiplier. If a read is retried 3× during incidents, your RU and request volume can triple.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Storage (GB-month)</h2>
  <p>
    Storage is usually the easy line item. Use average stored GB and model growth separately. If you retain history or store
    large documents, storage can become material over time.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Networking and egress</h2>
  <p>
    If your application reads from other regions or serves clients from multiple geographies, data transfer can add
    meaningful cost. Model outbound GB/month by destination.

  </p>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimating RU from averages and ignoring peaks (capacity is set by peak demand).</li>
    <li>Ignoring retries/timeouts that multiply operations (and therefore RU consumption).</li>
    <li>Not separating the top containers/queries (one hot partition can dominate).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate RU consumption and throttling during a representative peak window.</li>
    <li>Validate retry rates and incident behavior (retries multiply RU and request volume).</li>
    <li>Validate growth rate and retention policies for stored data.</li>
  </ul>
