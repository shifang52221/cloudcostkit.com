    Invalidations are part of operating a CDN. The cost impact is often indirect: aggressive invalidation reduces cache
    hit rate and can push more traffic to the origin (cache fill / origin egress).
  </p>

  <h2>What to count</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How often you invalidate (deploy frequency)</li>
    <li>How many paths you invalidate per deploy</li>
    <li>Whether you invalidate broad wildcards (like /*)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why invalidations can increase total cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lower cache hit rate for popular objects</li>
    <li>More origin requests and origin egress (cache fill)</li>
    <li>More load on the API or origin layer during deploy windows</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Safer patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use versioned asset URLs (hash-based filenames) for static assets.</li>
    <li>Invalidate only the paths that truly changed.</li>
    <li>Use sensible TTLs and caching headers so you invalidate less often.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
