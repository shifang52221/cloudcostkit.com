  <p>
    Invalidations are part of operating a CDN, but their cost impact is often <strong>indirect</strong>: aggressive
    invalidation lowers cache hit rate and pushes more traffic to the origin (origin requests + origin egress).
  </p>

  <h2>What counts as "invalidation volume"</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Batch count</strong>: how many invalidation requests you create per day/week (often tied to deploy frequency)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Paths per batch</strong>: explicit paths + wildcard paths
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Blast radius</strong>: whether you invalidate popular objects or broad patterns (for example, <code>/*</code>)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Direct vs indirect costs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Direct</strong>: CloudFront charges for invalidation requests beyond included quotas (check current pricing
      for your account).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Indirect</strong>: reduced cache hit rate during deploy windows - more origin requests and origin egress.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you invalidate frequently, the indirect cost (origin egress + origin load) can be larger than the direct
    invalidation line item.
  </p>

  <h2>A simple estimation workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Count invalidation batches/month.</li>
    <li>Count paths invalidated per batch (wildcards included).</li>
    <li>Identify which invalidated paths are popular (those drive the hit rate drop).</li>
    <li>
      Convert hit rate drop into origin traffic using the <a href="/guides/aws-cloudfront-cache-hit-rate/">hit rate model</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>When invalidations are actually needed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>HTML / app shell</strong>: you may need to invalidate a small set of routes after deploys.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>User-generated content</strong>: if you must purge quickly, invalidate only that prefix (for example, a single path subtree).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Security issues</strong>: broad invalidations are sometimes justified, but treat them as an operational event and measure impact.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Safer patterns (avoid invalidations where possible)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Version static assets</strong> with content hashes so deployments never need to purge JS/CSS/images.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use a TTL strategy</strong>: long TTL for hashed assets; shorter TTL for HTML.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Invalidate narrowly</strong>: purge only the specific HTML routes that changed (avoid <code>/*</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid cache fragmentation</strong>: keep cache keys stable (do not forward unnecessary query strings/cookies).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prefer versioned URLs over purges</strong>: if you can change the URL, you rarely need to invalidate.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Track hit rate before/after deploys to quantify real impact.</li>
    <li>Track origin request and origin byte spikes during deploy windows.</li>
    <li>Confirm your cache key policy so invalidations target the content you intend.</li>
    <li>Confirm users see new content without requiring broad purges.</li>
  </ul>
