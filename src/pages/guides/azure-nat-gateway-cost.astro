  <p>
    NAT Gateway pricing is simple on paper and tricky in production. The math is "hours + GB processed", but the bill is
    driven by what traverses NAT during <strong>peak</strong> periods: deploys, scale-outs, incidents, and dependency
    retries. This guide helps you build a model you can validate and improve.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Inventory what routes through NAT (the boundary)</h2>
  <p>Before you estimate anything, list the outbound paths that actually use NAT.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Which subnets</strong> have default routes that egress through NAT?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Which workloads</strong> live in those subnets (AKS nodes, VMSS, build runners, jump boxes)?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Which destinations</strong> are hit at scale (container registries, package repos, external APIs, SaaS, telemetry)?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you cannot answer this, you will estimate the wrong thing. NAT costs are not "internet egress" in general; they are
    "traffic that your routing sends through NAT".
  </p>

  <h2>1) Baseline hours (count NAT gateways)</h2>
  <p>
    The baseline is the number of NAT gateways times hours per month. If you have multiple environments or regions, model
    each separately (prod/stage/dev). If your architecture is hub-and-spoke, be explicit about whether one NAT is shared or
    whether each spoke has its own.
  </p>

  <h2>2) GB processed (the throughput driver)</h2>
  <p>
    The practical way to estimate GB processed is to list the big outbound flows and estimate each flow's monthly GB. Do not
    guess with one blended number if you have a few dominant flows.

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Container image pulls</strong>: AKS/VMSS churn, new node pools, autoscaling.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Package downloads</strong>: OS updates, language deps, CI caches.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>External APIs</strong>: request volume × response sizes (retries amplify).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Telemetry/log shipping</strong>: logs and metrics exporters often run "always on".
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Model the peak month (retries + churn)</h2>
  <p>
    A realistic model has at least two scenarios: baseline and peak. Peak is where NAT costs surprise teams.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Retries/timeouts</strong>: each retry repeats the full payload transfer; add a multiplier for incident windows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Node churn</strong>: new nodes pull images and dependencies with cold caches.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cold-start spikes</strong>: deployment rollouts can temporarily increase outbound dependency calls.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Practical levers to reduce cost (without breaking security)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cache the big outbound flows</strong>: registry mirrors, package proxies, artifact caching.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Move large dependencies off the hot path</strong>: avoid downloading large artifacts at runtime.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reduce retries</strong>: fix timeout budgets and backoff; retries are paid traffic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consider private access</strong> for high-volume Azure services (compare against Private Link).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>NAT gateways</strong> = count per env/region
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hours/month</strong> = 24 × days
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline GB/month</strong> = sum of big outbound flows routed via NAT
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak add-on GB</strong> = deploy + incident windows (image pulls + retries)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retry multiplier</strong> = 1 + retry_rate (apply to the affected flows)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate routing: which subnets and workloads are actually using NAT.</li>
    <li>Validate the top outbound destinations and their bytes in a representative week.</li>
    <li>Validate deploy/scale-out periods: compare GB/hour during peak vs baseline.</li>
    <li>After changes, re-measure outbound GB and confirm the model moves in the same direction as the bill.</li>
  </ul>
