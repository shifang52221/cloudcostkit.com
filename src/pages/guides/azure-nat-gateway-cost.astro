  <p>
    NAT gateways are deceptively simple: an hourly baseline plus a data processing driver. The real problem is that NAT sits
    on the hot path for outbound traffic, so any retry storm or oversized download can amplify cost.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Baseline hours</h2>
  <p>Model NAT gateway count × hours per month.</p>

  <h2>2) GB processed</h2>
  <p>
    The practical way to estimate GB processed is to list the major outbound flows routed via NAT: container pulls, package
    downloads, external API calls, telemetry, and backups. Then estimate monthly GB for each flow.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Common cost multipliers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Retries/timeouts to external APIs (each retry repeats full payload transfer).</li>
    <li>Image pulls during node churn or frequent redeploys.</li>
    <li>Uncached package downloads in CI or autoscaling environments.</li>
    <li>High-volume telemetry/log shipping routed through NAT.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate which subnets and workloads egress via NAT (routing tables matter).</li>
    <li>Validate peak periods (deployments, incidents, scale-outs) where GB processed spikes.</li>
    <li>Validate that large downloads are cached (registry mirrors, package proxies, CDN).</li>
  </ul>
