  <p>
    If you search for <em>CDN cost</em> or <em>CDN pricing</em>, you will usually see "$/GB" tables. In practice, a
    complete estimate often needs three buckets:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Edge bandwidth</strong>: GB delivered from the CDN edge to end users.</li>
    <li><strong>Request fees</strong>: request-based charges (common on some plans).</li>
    <li><strong>Origin egress (cache fill)</strong>: bytes pulled from your origin to the CDN (billed by your origin provider).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 1: Estimate bandwidth (GB/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Bandwidth is the anchor input for almost every CDN cost calculator. Get it from CDN analytics if you have them. If
    you only have throughput charts (Mbps), convert Mbps to GB/month using the{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a> or this guide:{" "}
    <a href="/guides/estimate-cdn-bandwidth-gb-per-month/">estimate CDN bandwidth</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then price it with <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN Bandwidth Cost Calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: Estimate request fees (requests/month)</h2>
  <p>
    Many pricing pages list request fees as "$ per 10k" or "$ per 1M". If you have requests/month from analytics or
    logs, use it. If you only have RPS, convert it with{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to Monthly Requests</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then price it with <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN Request Cost Calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: Model origin egress (cache fill) if you pay for it</h2>
  <p>
    The most common under-estimate is forgetting that cache misses (and cache fill) move bytes from your origin to the
    CDN. That traffic is typically billed as <strong>origin egress</strong> by your origin provider (object storage,
    load balancer, VM, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    A simple starting point if you do not have metrics yet:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin egress (GB/month) ~ CDN bandwidth (GB/month) x (1 - cache hit rate)</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For a deeper explanation (and common double-counting mistakes), see{" "}
    <a href="/guides/origin-egress-vs-cdn-bandwidth/">origin egress vs CDN bandwidth</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validate your estimate (before you trust the number)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Confirm whether your origin provider bills <strong>origin-to-CDN</strong> traffic as internet egress, inter-region
      transfer, or a special CDN integration line item.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use multiple origins (API + static assets), estimate origin egress per origin (they often have different
      $/GB).
    </li>
    <li>Sanity check with logs/metrics: cache hit rate, origin request rate, and bytes served from origin.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Other line items that can matter</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>WAF / bot protection</strong>: often billed per request and can spike with bot traffic.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs / analytics</strong>: delivery, retention, and query/scan charges depending on provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimization add-ons</strong>: image optimization, video packaging, signed URLs, functions, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Invalidations</strong>: sometimes billed, sometimes free within limits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Worked example (quick sanity check)</h2>
  <p>
    Suppose you expect 4,000 GB/month delivered and 300M requests/month:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bandwidth: 4,000 x $0.06/GB = $240/month</li>
    <li>Requests: 300,000,000 / 10,000 x $0.0075 = $225/month</li>
    <li>Total (before origin egress): about $465/month</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If your cache hit rate is 85%, a rough cache-fill estimate is 4,000 x (1 - 0.85) = 600 GB/month of origin egress,
    priced at your origin provider's rate.
