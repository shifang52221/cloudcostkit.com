  <p>
    CDNs are usually priced around two big buckets: <strong>bandwidth</strong> (GB delivered from edge to users) and
    <strong>requests</strong> (how many HTTP requests your users make). Many teams underestimate the third bucket:
    <strong>origin egress</strong> (bytes your origin sends to the CDN during cache fill and misses).
  </p>

  <h2>What to include in a CDN cost estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Edge bandwidth (GB/month)</strong>: traffic delivered to end users.</li>
    <li><strong>Request fees (requests/month)</strong>: billed per 10k or per million requests on some plans.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin egress</strong>: bytes from your origin to the CDN (cache misses, fills, prefetch).</li>
    <li><strong>Optional line items</strong>: logs/analytics, WAF/bot, image/video optimization, invalidations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fast estimation workflow (5 minutes)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Estimate <strong>bandwidth GB/month</strong> from CDN analytics (best) or from throughput using the{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/unit-converter/">Units Converter</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Estimate <strong>requests/month</strong> from CDN analytics (best) or from RPS using{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to Monthly Requests</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Price bandwidth with the <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN Bandwidth Cost Calculator</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Price request fees with the <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN Request Cost Calculator</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you pay for origin egress, model it separately with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Data Egress Cost Calculator</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common pitfalls (why estimates are off)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cache hit rate confusion</strong>: cache hit rate reduces origin egress, but edge bandwidth to users is
      still edge bandwidth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tiered pricing</strong>: many CDNs have tiers by region and volume. If you don't know distribution, use a
      blended $/GB and sanity-check multiple scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dynamic traffic</strong>: APIs and personalized pages can increase request fees even when bandwidth is
      modest.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Large objects</strong>: video and large downloads can dominate bandwidth even with low request volume.
    </li>
  </ul>
