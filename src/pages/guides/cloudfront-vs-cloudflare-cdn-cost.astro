  <p>
    The easiest way to compare CloudFront vs Cloudflare cost is to treat the CDN bill as a set of line items, not a single
    number. If you model the same line items for both providers, you can swap pricing assumptions and see which driver
    actually dominates for <em>your</em> traffic.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Start with the same 3 core line items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Bandwidth</strong>: GB delivered from edge to end users ($/GB).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests</strong>: request fees (often per 10k or per 1M) if applicable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin egress (cache fill)</strong>: bytes pulled from origin to CDN on cache misses, billed by your origin provider.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Bandwidth is not the same as origin egress. If you double-count those legs, your comparison will be wrong.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Measure traffic inputs (baseline + peak)</h2>
  <p>
    Use a representative window (a normal week and an incident week if you have one). CDNs are often dominated by peak
    events: bot traffic, marketing spikes, deploys that reduce cache hit rate, and incidents.

  </p>

  <h2>2) Model origin egress from hit rate (the cache fill leg)</h2>
  <p>
    A practical estimate is:
    <strong> origin GB ~= edge GB * (1 - hit rate)</strong>. Purges, low TTLs, and deploys can temporarily crush hit rate and
    spike origin traffic.

  </p>

  <h2>3) Add-ons that commonly flip the winner</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>WAF / bot mitigation</strong>: security add-ons can dominate for attack-heavy traffic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Logs</strong>: access logs at high request volume can be expensive (ingestion + retention + scans).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge compute</strong>: functions/worker usage can become its own cost center.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Image optimization</strong>: can reduce bandwidth but add compute/caching costs depending on plan.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you enable add-ons, model them as explicit line items instead of hiding them inside $/GB.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Comparison checklist (what to verify)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Region mix</strong>: split GB and requests by region if you can; pricing often differs by geography.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Request units</strong>: per 10k vs per 1M (order-of-magnitude mistakes are common).
      <span class="muted">
        {" "}
        Guide: <a href="/guides/cdn-request-pricing/">CDN request pricing</a>.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hit rate</strong>: validate hit rate by path; one large endpoint can dominate origin egress even if overall hit rate looks good.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peaks</strong>: model bot spikes and incident windows separately.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Commitments</strong>: discounts change the effective rate; ensure you model realistic utilization.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Worked template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge GB/month</strong> = baseline + peak
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Edge requests/month</strong> = baseline + peak (include bots/retries)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin GB/month</strong> ~= edge GB/month * (1 - hit rate) (model purge/deploy separately)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add-ons</strong> = WAF + logs + edge compute (explicit line items)
    </li>
  </ul>
