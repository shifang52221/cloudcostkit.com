  <p>
    People often search for <em>CloudFront vs Cloudflare pricing</em> or <em>CloudFront vs Cloudflare cost</em>. The
    easiest way to get a useful answer is to compare the bill as a set of line items, not as one number.
  </p>

  <h2>Start with the same 3 line items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: GB delivered from the edge to end users ($/GB).</li>
    <li><strong>Requests</strong>: request fees (often $ per 10k or per 1M) if applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin egress (cache fill)</strong>: bytes pulled from origin to the CDN, billed by your origin provider.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you model these three consistently, you can compare providers without being tripped up by marketing terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Comparison checklist</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Bandwidth unit and regions</strong>: pricing varies by geography. If you can, split your GB/month by the
      main regions your users are in.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Request pricing and request classes</strong>: confirm whether requests are billed and in what units (per
      10k vs per 1M). Read <a href="/guides/cdn-request-pricing/">CDN request pricing</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cache hit rate and origin egress</strong>: if hit rate is low, origin egress can become a major cost.
      Read <a href="/guides/origin-egress-vs-cdn-bandwidth/">origin egress vs CDN bandwidth</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add-ons</strong>: WAF, bot management, logs, image optimization, and edge functions can dominate total cost
      for some workloads.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Commitments and bundles</strong>: discounts can change the effective $/GB, but make sure to model usage
      realistically.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>A simple way to compare costs</h2>
  <p>
    Use the same traffic inputs for both providers, then swap the pricing assumptions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use <a href="/calculators/cdn-cost-calculator/">CDN Cost Calculator</a> for a vendor-neutral model.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use <a href="/calculators/cloudfront-cost-calculator/">CloudFront Cost Calculator</a> if you want CloudFront-style defaults and wording.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When results are counterintuitive</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Requests dominate</strong>: API-heavy traffic can pay more in request fees than bandwidth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin egress dominates</strong>: low cache hit rate shifts spend to your origin provider.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>WAF/logs dominate</strong>: security and observability add-ons can exceed delivery cost.
    </li>
  </ul>
