  {
    q: "Should I budget blocked requests?",
    a: "Yes. For cost models, use evaluated requests (allowed + blocked). During bot spikes, blocked traffic can dominate request counts.",

  <p>
    WAF cost spikes are usually not caused by \"more rules\" - they're caused by <strong>more evaluated requests</strong>.
    During attacks, blocked traffic can explode request volume and create an additional surprise: <strong>security log
    cost</strong> can grow with it.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: separate steady traffic from surge traffic</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Steady</strong>: your typical 30-day traffic.</li>
    <li><strong>Surge</strong>: bot spikes, credential stuffing, scraping, or DDoS-like bursts.</li>
    <li><strong>Include blocked traffic</strong>: for billing, it's often evaluated even when blocked.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: convert surge RPS into added monthly requests</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Simple approximation: <strong>extra requests = surge RPS x surge seconds</strong>. Then add to your steady
    requests/month.

  </div>

  <h2>Step 3: reduce evaluated requests (high leverage)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cache</strong> aggressively for cacheable routes (especially for abusive hot paths).</li>
    <li><strong>Rate-limit</strong> early for known abusive endpoints (login, search, auth token endpoints).</li>
    <li><strong>Block</strong> obvious bot paths and bad user agents with targeted rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Move traffic up</strong> the stack: stop bad traffic at the CDN edge when possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: don't let security logging become the bigger bill</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sample or filter logs for high-volume endpoints where full fidelity isn't required.</li>
    <li>Set retention intentionally for noisy logs.</li>
    <li>Optimize queries and dashboards to avoid repeated large scans.</li>
  </ul>
