    DynamoDB is easy to start with and easy to mis-estimate. The safest approach is to break cost into three buckets:
    reads, writes, and storage, then add any heavy features (streams/backups) as separate line items.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Start with reads and writes</h2>
  <p>
    Your request volume (and item size) drives most DynamoDB spend. If you only know throughput (RPS), convert first using{" "}
    <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to monthly requests</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-dynamodb-cost-calculator/">AWS DynamoDB Cost Calculator</a> to model read/write request
    fees with your own effective pricing inputs.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Model storage separately</h2>
  <p>
    Storage is usually a steady baseline. If your dataset is growing, forecast the next 3–12 months to avoid “silent
    growth” surprises.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/database-storage-growth-cost-calculator/">Database Storage Growth Calculator</a> to project
    GB over time.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Common extra line items</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Backups/snapshots</strong>: long retention and high churn can create meaningful recurring storage spend.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Streams</strong>: change capture can add cost if used at scale.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data transfer</strong>: model egress separately if your app serves lots of traffic.
    </li>
  </ul>
