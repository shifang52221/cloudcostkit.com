    Request pricing looks small until volume grows. This page gives you a quick workflow to estimate requests/month,
    translate request units correctly, and sanity check the number before you trust it.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Get or estimate requests/month</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best</strong>: provider analytics, logs, or billing exports (measured request counts).</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fallback</strong>: convert from RPS with{" "}
      <a href="/calculators/rps-to-monthly-requests-calculator/">RPS to Monthly Requests</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Confirm request units (per 10k vs per 1M)</h2>
  <p>
    Pricing pages often quote "$ per 10k" or "$ per 1M". If you multiply by the wrong unit, the estimate can be off by
    100x.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Estimate request cost</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      API requests: <a href="/calculators/api-request-cost-calculator/">API request cost calculator</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      CDN requests: <a href="/calculators/cdn-request-cost-calculator/">CDN request cost calculator</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      For CDNs, also model bandwidth with <a href="/calculators/cdn-bandwidth-cost-calculator/">CDN bandwidth cost</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Validate (avoid surprise multipliers)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Identify retry loops and timeouts. These can multiply API request volume and add transfer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Separate human traffic from bots. WAF/bot protection costs can track request spikes.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're behind a CDN, cache miss rate affects origin request volume even if CDN request counts stay high.
    </li>
  </ul>
