  <p>
    AKS cost planning fails when you only count nodes. A realistic estimate is a checklist across compute, networking,
    storage, and observability - and it validates packing assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>0) Define the cluster scope (what exists and where)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Environments</strong>: prod + staging + dev clusters (non-prod baselines are commonly missed).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Node pools</strong>: system pools + user pools, plus GPU/spot pools if used.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak vs average</strong>: autoscaling makes averages look cheap; peaks decide capacity and cost.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Node pools (VM hours)</h2>
  <p>
    Model each node pool separately: instance type, number of nodes, and hours per month. If you autoscale, model average
    and peak node counts.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>2) Workload packing (requests/limits)</h2>
  <p>
    Requests/limits determine packing and therefore node count. Over-requesting CPU/memory is one of the most common cost
    leaks in Kubernetes.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-requests-limits-calculator/">Requests/limits helper</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Networking and egress</h2>
  <p>
    Egress from pods (to the internet, to other regions, or to external services) is frequently underestimated. Split
    internal traffic from billable egress and validate cache behavior when using CDNs.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Load balancing and ingress</h2>
  <p>
    Many clusters pay for ingress and L7 features separately (load balancers, gateways, WAF, and access logs). Budget
    ingress explicitly so it does not hide inside "Kubernetes cost".
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>5) Storage (persistent volumes)</h2>
  <p>
    Persistent storage is a GB-month driver. Include snapshots/backups if you rely on them, and validate retention windows.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/storage-pricing-calculator/">Storage pricing (generic)</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Observability (logs/metrics)</h2>
  <p>
    Logging and metrics scale with pod count and verbosity. Model ingestion and retention separately; logs can exceed node
    compute if you ingest too much.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">Log cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Worked estimate template (copy/paste)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Compute</strong> = sum(node pool nodes * $/hour * hours) for baseline + peak
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egress</strong> = outbound GB/month (internet + cross-region) * $/GB
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong> = PV GB-month + snapshots/backups (if used)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Observability</strong> = ingestion GB/month + retention GB-month + query scans
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Over-requesting CPU/memory and paying for empty headroom.</li>
    <li>Forgetting DaemonSets and system overhead (CNI, monitoring, logging) that consume capacity on every node.</li>
    <li>Budgeting only average autoscaling and missing frequent peak scale-outs.</li>
    <li>Missing outbound transfer and origin egress when using CDNs.</li>
    <li>Letting logs grow without sampling, retention, and query guardrails.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate kube-system overhead and DaemonSets (logging, CNI, monitoring) that consume node capacity.</li>
    <li>Validate autoscaling behavior: average vs peak nodes, and whether scale-outs are frequent.</li>
    <li>Validate egress boundaries (internet vs internal) and measure real outbound GB in a representative window.</li>
  </ul>
