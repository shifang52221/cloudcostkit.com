  <p>
    AKS cost planning fails when you only count nodes. A realistic estimate is a checklist across compute, networking,
    storage, and observability - and it validates packing assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Node pools (VM hours)</h2>
  <p>
    Model each node pool separately: instance type, number of nodes, and hours per month. If you autoscale, model average
    and peak node counts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/compute-instance-cost-calculator/">Compute instance cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Workload packing (requests/limits)</h2>
  <p>
    Requests/limits determine packing and therefore node count. Over-requesting CPU/memory is one of the most common cost
    leaks in Kubernetes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/kubernetes-requests-limits-calculator/">Requests/limits helper</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Networking and egress</h2>
  <p>
    Egress from pods (to the internet, to other regions, or to external services) is frequently underestimated. Split
    “internal” traffic from billable egress and validate cache behavior when using CDNs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/data-egress-cost-calculator/">Egress cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Storage (persistent volumes)</h2>
  <p>
    Persistent storage is a GB-month driver. Include snapshots/backups if you rely on them, and validate retention windows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/storage-pricing-calculator/">Storage pricing (generic)</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Observability (logs/metrics)</h2>
  <p>
    Logging and metrics scale with pod count and verbosity. Model ingestion and retention separately; logs can exceed node
    compute if you ingest too much.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tool: <a href="/calculators/log-cost-calculator/">Log cost calculator</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate kube-system overhead and DaemonSets (logging, CNI, monitoring) that consume node capacity.</li>
    <li>Validate autoscaling behavior: average vs peak nodes, and whether scale-outs are frequent.</li>
    <li>Validate egress boundaries (internet vs internal) and measure real outbound GB in a representative window.</li>
  </ul>
