    Fargate cost optimization is usually about <strong>reducing idle capacity</strong> and{" "}
    <strong>not paying for hidden line items</strong> (logs and networking). Use this checklist to find the biggest
    levers first.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Rightsize vCPU and memory</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure steady CPU and memory usage and trim oversizing.</li>
    <li>Prefer smaller tasks with more replicas when it improves utilization (within latency constraints).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Scale on real signals (and validate average tasks)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use request/queue depth signals, not just CPU percent.</li>
    <li>Estimate average running tasks per month and compare it to peak.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce logging costs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Drop noisy debug logs in production.</li>
    <li>Sample high-volume access logs where acceptable.</li>
    <li>Set retention intentionally; don’t keep everything forever.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Reduce networking surprises</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid routing AWS-service traffic through NAT when endpoints/private access makes sense.</li>
    <li>Watch cross-AZ chatter for chatty microservices and service discovery patterns.</li>
    <li>Model internet egress explicitly for public APIs and downloads.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
