    Retrieval time is a workflow constraint, not just a pricing detail. Plan restore tiers and job timing so your
    analytics, audits, or reprocessing pipelines are not blocked by long restore windows.
  </p>

  <h2>What "retrieval time" means</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Restore request submitted</strong>: you ask for objects to be made readable.</li>
    <li><strong>Restore completes</strong>: objects become readable for a temporary window.</li>
    <li><strong>Restore window</strong>: how long the restored copy is kept available.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tier-driven latency (plan with ranges)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Expedited tiers</strong>: fastest, but more expensive and sometimes capacity-limited.</li>
    <li><strong>Standard tiers</strong>: balanced latency and cost for typical restores.</li>
    <li><strong>Bulk tiers</strong>: cheapest, but slowest; best for large backfills.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Deep Archive tiers are slower than Glacier tiers. Always plan with a buffer, not a single exact duration.
  </p>

  <h2>Operational factors that slow restores</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Concurrency limits</strong>: too many parallel restore jobs can queue.</li>
    <li><strong>Object count</strong>: many small objects create more requests and coordination overhead.</li>
    <li><strong>Job scheduling</strong>: restore windows that overlap with peak operations can delay downstream processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to choose a tier (quick decision flow)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you need same-day access, plan for faster tiers and budget the peak month.</li>
    <li>If restores are rare and not urgent, use bulk tiers to reduce cost.</li>
    <li>If you are unsure, model two scenarios and compare cost vs latency impact.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Plan for a restore window</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Restores are temporary; define how long you need the data available.</li>
    <li>Make sure downstream jobs finish within the restore window.</li>
    <li>Use prefetch or staged restores for large backfills.</li>
  </ul>
