    VPC endpoints are often deployed to reduce NAT costs and improve security. Cost optimization is mostly about reducing
    the multipliers (endpoints x AZs) and validating your traffic path.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Consolidate endpoints (reduce endpoint count)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Inventory which services actually require interface endpoints.</li>
    <li>Avoid duplicating endpoints across many VPCs/environments without need.</li>
    <li>Prefer shared patterns where appropriate (with clear ownership and guardrails).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Right-size AZ coverage (reduce the AZ multiplier)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Model the cost difference between 2-AZ and 3-AZ deployments.</li>
    <li>Only use 3 AZs when the workload's resiliency requirements justify it.</li>
    <li>Validate that your architecture actually benefits from the extra AZ.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Reduce endpoint GB processed (the traffic lever)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Stop retry storms: timeouts and retries can multiply traffic.</li>
    <li>Reduce repeated large downloads (package mirrors, container image caching).</li>
    <li>Use caching to cut repeated API calls where safe.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Avoid cross-AZ transfer surprises</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep clients and backends AZ-local where possible.</li>
    <li>Validate load balancer target selection patterns and client routing.</li>
    <li>Re-check after changes: some "optimizations" move traffic across boundaries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Quantify with a calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Use <a href="/calculators/aws-vpc-interface-endpoint-cost-calculator/">VPC Interface Endpoint Cost Calculator</a> to
    model endpoint-hours + per-GB processing. Run scenarios for endpoint count and AZs.

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
