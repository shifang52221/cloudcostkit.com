  <p>
    Aurora Serverless v2 is priced primarily by <strong>ACU-hours</strong>, so you should estimate it like a time-series
    bill: a baseline most hours, plus peaks that happen during batch jobs, traffic spikes, or incidents. If you budget
    from a single average ACU, you usually under-estimate.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: pick baseline and peak scenarios (don’t start with one number)</h2>
  <p>
    Write down two scenarios you can defend:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline</strong>: typical ACUs during steady operation (most hours).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak</strong>: ACUs during known heavy windows (backfills, reports, spikes, deploy storms).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you know your configured min/max, baseline is often close to min, and peak should be bounded by max (or your
    expected upper range).
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: estimate ACU-hours</h2>
  <p>
    ACU-hours is just “capacity × time”. For a planning model:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Baseline ACU-hours</strong> = baseline ACU × baseline hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak ACU-hours</strong> = peak ACU × peak hours/month
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Total</strong> = baseline ACU-hours + peak ACU-hours
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    Worked example: baseline 2 ACU always-on → 2 × 730 = 1,460 ACU-hours. Peak 8 ACU for 2 hours/day → 8 × 60 = 480
    ACU-hours. Total ≈ 1,940 ACU-hours/month.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: add storage and backup retention as stable baselines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage</strong>: average GB-month (and forecast if the database is growing).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backups</strong>: backup GB-month driven by retention and churn.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Step 4: stress-test your budget (the “what if it happens weekly?” test)</h2>
  <p>
    The best guardrail is to ask: what if the peak window happens every day or every week? If your estimate can’t absorb
    that, you’ll get surprised by routine operational events (deploys, backfills, retries).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Backfills and migrations (data reshaping or index builds)</li>
    <li>Report generation and analytics queries</li>
    <li>Upstream incidents that cause retries and timeouts</li>
    <li>Seasonal traffic spikes and product launches</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Assuming serverless means “auto-pauses to zero” (v2 is not the same as older models).</li>
    <li>Using a short load test and extrapolating to a month without modeling peaks.</li>
    <li>Ignoring retention: backups can become a steady cost even if compute is perfect.</li>
    <li>Budgeting from max capacity only (overestimates) or average only (underestimates) instead of scenarios.</li>
    <li>Missing “around the DB” costs: logs, metrics, and transfer when apps aren’t co-located.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to validate after you go live</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In CUR / Cost Explorer, identify the ACU-hours usage line and compare baseline vs peak months.</li>
    <li>Compare the time shape in metrics to billing: do peaks happen daily, weekly, or only during incidents?</li>
    <li>After tuning min/max, re-check that latency and failover behavior still meet requirements.</li>
  </ul>
