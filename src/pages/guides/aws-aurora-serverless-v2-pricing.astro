  <p>
    Aurora Serverless v2 estimates should be built as scenarios: a baseline (typical ACUs) and at least one peak case.
    If you model only an average, you will usually under-budget for spiky workloads.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Build a baseline ACU-hours estimate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimate your typical ACUs during steady operation.</li>
    <li>Convert to monthly usage: ACU-hours = avg ACU x hours/month.</li>
    <li>Price with your effective $/ACU-hour for the region.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Add a peak scenario (the part that protects the budget)</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Peak model: peak ACU x peak hours per month (for example, 8 ACU for 2 hours/day).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Traffic spikes, launches, and incident response</li>
    <li>Batch jobs, ETL, and large backfills</li>
    <li>Retry storms from upstream timeouts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Add storage and backups</h2>
  <p>
    Compute is only one part of the bill. Add storage GB-month and backup GB-month (retention + churn) as separate line
    items.
  </p>

  <h2>Validation checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate the primary driver with measured usage from a representative window.</li>
    <li>Confirm units and pricing units (per 10k vs per 1M, GB vs GiB) before trusting the estimate.</li>
    <li>Re-check incident windows: retries/timeouts often multiply cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
